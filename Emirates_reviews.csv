0,"✅ Trip Verified |  Do not fly with Emirates if you don’t like to be squashed by obese passengers.  I pay full price and more for a flex ticket, but I only get 3/4 of a seat as the obese person next to me far is overflowing into my chair.  When I insisted to be moved to another chair it took the staff 15 minutes for the cabin staff to even respond to my calls, they were too busy chatting at the crew area, I was watching them. I had to press the crew call button on and off over 20 times, that’s no exaggeration, before someone came to ask me what I wanted. After pointing out what was going on I was moved to the chair closest to the toilet, almost in the toilet, I could hear everything inside the bathroom. The seat they put me in sticks out into the aisle so every time the air hostess would walk past they would knock my chair, completely lacking awareness or care for the passengers. They really don’t care. it’s difficult to imagine a more incompetent bunch of cabin staff and management controlling an airline. It is 100% the last time I’ll ever consider flying Emirates. I didnt even have have space to even eat my meal so I couldn’t ask for my dinner I couldn’t rest without being leaned on and knocked constantly by the customer overflowing into my chair. This is absolutely unacceptable. ",5,20th March 2024,Thailand
1,"✅ Trip Verified |  Had perishable item, the airline sent is as special luggage and left it behind. As it was a item of importance to me and I was very sad that it was left behind. Very disappointed with Emirates",1,17th March 2024,United Arab Emirates
2,"✅ Trip Verified |  I book my flight from Emirates for my 2 kids me and my wife, paid amount from my card to Emirates. the flight was from Riyadh to Islamabad via Dubai. Departure time from Riyadh was 4:25 PM on 9th of march and arrival time was 7:10 Pm on same date in dubai airport. the 2 hour stay and then departure from Dubai at 9:10 PM same date and arrival 1:30 AM 10th of march. We were handed over to Flydubai from emirates  which was strange bu Ok we did boarding and got notification that flight is delayed.. Total delay in Riyadh was 4 and half hours and reached very late to Dubai airport and the connecting flight were missed. We approach to emirates counter and they rudely refuse to provide us any service because we were having flydubai boarding passes and told us to deal with Flydubai. Long story short we were dealt with like animals for 18 hours in airport and depart to another airport which were around 700 KM away from our  ticketed airport and does not provide any transfortatin from that airport. The car were arranged by us which cost us around 250$. I will never recommend Emirates and flydubai to anyone.",1,13th March 2024,Pakistan
3,"✅ Trip Verified |  The service provided is absolutely unacceptable and beyond what I’ve ever experienced. The flight from Lisbon to Dubai was delayed by 3 hrs. Connecting flight to Phuket was missed due to that which of course can happen but there was zero handling of the situation in Dubai - it took 4,5 hours at the airport standing in lines to get a new boarding pass and a hotel voucher. Before that no information at all. After all this they take you to a hotel which is 30 minutes away from the airport without telling before which hotel and where it is - arriving at the hotel another long waiting session and then no one can say when the shuttle bus is going back to the airport - we don’t have that information, end of conversation! Zero information. Zero service. I booked seats on the flight in advance to be able to rest and in the email about the new flight it said the booked seat will remain for the new flight but that is not the case at all. So now instead of my paid window seat I’m sitting straight in the middle. All the service chat tells you is to file a complaint. Also I paid for a hotel in Phuket that I don’t get to use. This was by far the worst I’ve ever experienced by any airline. It’s such a joke, the way they treat people, their customers. Especially at the airport- no one cared at all for all of the travelers facing this situation. Everyone was treated with pure ignorance. Biggest mistreatment and miss organization ever! Don’t book this airline!",1,10th March 2024,Germany
4,"✅ Trip Verified |  We choose the twin seats at back of plane as this is a long flight and paid for them, well worth the extra on this long flight.The captain kept us updated on turbulence and seatbelt reminder throughout flight. Cabin crew professional and available when needed, plenty of drinks available. Have flown Emirates since 2012 when flying to Europe never had a bad experience, always Economy but been fortunate to be offered upgrade x2. Gluten free meals the best.",1,9th March 2024,Australia
5,✅ Trip Verified |  Venice to Dubai. My husband & I checked in online 48 hours before departure. Arrived at Venice Marco Polo Airport and took the online check-in line which was very short. The Emirates check-in was very good and answered our questions about our onward flight when arriving in Dubai further connection which was with Qantas to regional airport. We were surprised when given all three boarding passes for continuation to final destination with Qantas Chose aisle seats C/D as far back as possible. Flight was excellent with multilingual crew and co pilot Australian Captain from El Salvador. Always fly to & from to Europe with Emirates well looked after and the best gluten free meals. Arrived on time.,10,8th March 2024,Australia
6,"✅ Trip Verified |  Our BKK-DXB flight was delayed for 18 hours and as a result we missed our DXB WAW connecting flight. We were offered a long flight with one more transfer DXX-LJU - WAW no longer on Emirates and FlyDubai on budget airlines where the standard was far below expectations. Unfortunately, because of Emirates we also missed the next transfer and instead of 16 hours our journey lasted over 60 hours. The worst thing is that the Emirates hotline showed no interest in our problems. We personally had to nervously look for connections to WAW. I filed a complaint, but Emirates did not respond. They awarded bonus miles instead, but I never want to use Emirates again. It is certainly not a premium airline which shows absolutely no interest to problems of their passengers and to their misconduct. I feel robbed. If I had been focused on low price, not taking service / comfort / time of journey, I would have chosen some different airline paying less. Yet, I paid much, much more and I got absolutely long journey, poor service, absolute disrespect from Emirates hotline, and no refund. They gave me worthless bonus miles. Never again am I going to fly with Emirates - budget airlines seem to be a better option with lower prices",10,4th March 2024,Poland
7,✅ Trip Verified |  Definitely not the standard I would expect from a premium airline. Business class seats and layout are dated and service levels at gates and checking in are well below other competitors. The economy class is well below Qatar Airways too. Counter staff are unhelpful especially at the UK counters. I would have been better off trying Saudia instead. This is definitely not the experience of Emirates that I have had over 10 years ago. Qatar Airways really puts them to shame.,1,4th March 2024,United Kingdom
8,"✅ Trip Verified |  My husband and I bought tickets to do Paris Seychelles transit Dubai. On arrival in Seychelles my suitcase was not delivered to us. We wait 25 minutes. And at the end of that time, a plastic bag arrives closed with a ribbon into which a quarter of my remaining belongings are thrown. Everything else was stolen. The suitcase was therefore opened despite an empty padlock and the rest of my belongings stashed in a plastic bag. I immediately opened a dispute, sending 37 emails since January 6. I called every two days, no one answered me. I only received automatic emails, with zero follow-up concerning me. I therefore lost more than €6,000 in business, not including the round trip to Paris Seychelles. Unacceptable treatment of customers. Nous avons acheté Mon Mari et moi des billets pour faire Paris Seychelles transit Dubaï. À l’arrivée aux Seychelles ma valise ne nous est pas livré. Nous attendons 25 minutes. Et au bout de ce temps-là, arrive un sac plastique fermé par un ruban dans lequel sont jetés un quart de mes affaires Qui restait. Tout le reste a été volé. La valise a donc été ouverte malgré un cadenas vidé et le reste de mes affaires planqué dans un sac en plastique. J’ai immédiatement ouvert un litige, envoyer 37 mails depuis le 6 janvier. J’ai appelé tous les deux jours, personne ne m’a répondu. Je n’ai que reçu des mails automatiques, Avec zéro suivi me concernant. J’ai perdu donc plus de 6000 € d’affaires, sans compter l’aller-retour, Paris Seychelles. Inadmissible le traitement des clients.",3,3rd March 2024,France
9,"✅ Trip Verified | Every step of the travel, I found harassment, terrible customer support, and absolutely no help. I am treated like an economy class customer in all aspects. Check-in: 1. Rude arrogant check in staff at SFO: refused to accommodate a box that exceeded 59 inches though far underweight than half of 70 kgs allowed. Arrogant staff refused to ever entertain my request as the app clearly mentioned that I could take up to 115 inches, without mentioning additional cost over 59 inches. 2. Reached DXB. At the gate, someone came over with my name and he was not aware of hotel option despite mentioning that I received it in my last trip. When I finally approach Terminal 3 First class lounge, they gave me hotel voucher after a lot of time. Even lounge front desk didn't have that information. 3. The lounge front desk refused to help me get to chauffeur service, didn't tell me 'EXACT' steps on how to reach Arrivals. It was the most terrible experience for someone going there for the first time. The desk that manages Chauffer service was incompetent and provided inaccurate gate info where I could get car to hotel. All this exercise took 1.5 hours, eating up on my plans to go out to the city. 4. When I checked back in the following day, 27th Feb, the second bag was not loaded despite being first class, despite paying for it and despite 19 hours of transit. When I landed and waited for it at carousel, app displayed delayed bag with PIR info. 5. Apparently the customer service agents pretended that they cannot get my contact details to update the baggage claim report/PIR and kept blaming me for it. They knew the flight I was in, the bag number and access to my profile, but kept saying that they can't update me because I didn't provide phone number and email address, both were there in my Emirates profile long before my travel date. 6. No communication on missed bag despite repeated contacts with customer support. Emirates has provided the worst travel experience all around in spite of paying for first class and for additional baggage. This is my last trip with Emirates and request everyone to not waste their money/miles on Emirates. You will always hit a wall in getting somethin we think is customer service. There will be no help, no customer support, no sensitivity or understanding. All I experienced is arrogant highhandedness, no respect for customers.",1,28th February 2024,United States
10,"Not Verified | Do not fly with Emirates and FlyDubai. Extremely poor management from Emirates and Dubai Airport. Did not have permission to leave Baghdad and had to wait for 4 hours and arrived late to connection flight to Sydney. Once arrived to Dubai, provided new flight in 9 hours with no accommodation and no other services. This is an example of extreme mismanagement of Dubai Airport and Emirates. And when you ask their staff for help, they literary try to ignore you.",2,22nd February 2024,Australia
11,"✅ Trip Verified |  Booked flight on Emirates website but first part of journey was from regional Australia with Qantas flight. Luggage checked all way through to Dubai so did not have to transfer it at Brisbane. Checked in on line and when arrived in Brisbane the customer service was very good allowing us to change seats to back of plane as was not a full flight so had 3 seats for 2 passengers, a very comfortable flight and the cabin crew bringing around drinks between meal service. Arrived Safely in Dubai on time.",1,21st February 2024,Australia
12,"Not Verified |  A real disappointment. Emirates costs 25% more than Etihad or Qatar for the same route, but the service was bad. First flight was 2,5 hours late. The seat I selected was reassigned by the system and no explanations were given at the counter. Return flight was 1 hour late. Online check in system was down for two days and I could not select a seat (getting a terrible one location at the check-in counter). Guess this is my last time with Emirates, since there are cheaper and better performing options on the same route.",10,12th February 2024,Italy
13,"Not Verified |  I flew the same route last year, and it is obvious that Emirates are using older planes on this route. Screens do not stay in place and no usb port at seat. Food was acceptable and crew friendly. More modern aircraft would improve the experience.",2,11th February 2024,United Kingdom
14,"✅ Trip Verified |  First time i have lost my baggage after arrival and the help was next to nothing. 1 out of my 2 baggage was missing after we have arrived in Singapore airport. After waiting at the belt and asking a member of staff at the airport then we have found out that this baggage tag was no scanned at my transfer in Dubai. therefore the baggage was somewhere in Dubai not knowing if it has been identified or lost yet. The airport team gave me a Reference and told me that they will keep me updated. i asked for a number to call to the airport office and they provided a number on the form. Next day called the number it was a switch board and after multiple attempts and speaking to the agent you cannot transfer to the airport counter and they do not know anything They tell you that someone will be in touch but that is not true. The customer service helpline on Emirates website is useless as you cannot get through or speak to a real person for help. I had no idea the next couple of days where my luggage was or if it is lost? No communication what so ever throughout, multiple emails/ calls/ feedback to emirates but no response. The customer affair team takes 9 months to even reply. i have another outstanding experience in April 2023 from Tokyo to Manchester where of on my luggage was smashed and they have not offered any compensation but asked me to to go a repair centre for a quote after 8 months of the incident. Took them 8 months to acknowledge my claim and probably made 20 phone calls to change after multiple email. They have the worse customer service if you was to encounter a problem or issue.",8,8th February 2024,United Kingdom
15,"✅ Trip Verified |  My Emirates experience was horrific, starting at Delhi airport where ground staff threatened to deny boarding unless I forced my laptop into my carry-on.  Boarding pass retrieval led to another confrontation at the gate. Emirates staff at the gate confiscated my boarding passes, threatened baggage offloading, and harassed me for carrying my laptop bag separately. Only after pledging to stow my laptop bag under my seat was I allowed to board just before departure. Upon reaching LA, I discovered a missing bag. It took days for Emirates to locate it. Emirates staff, without notice or gate codes, knocked at midnight, delivering my damaged bag. How they accessed it remains a mystery. The bag was torn, belongings damaged, and some items were missing. Despite three complaints, Emirates provided no response. Despite reaching out multiple times, Emirates offered no explanations, leaving me frustrated and dissatisfied with their customer service. ",1,2nd February 2024,United States
16,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first trip on Emirates. I paid $1,400 for my economy ticket. I also paid to select my seats. I specifically chose an aisle seat because I have neuropathy and needed to ensure I could stand up regularly to avoid blood clots & not disturb others. Immediately, I noticed the man sitting next to me, sharing an armrest with me, that he dominated, was sniffing and digging hard up his nose every couple of minutes nonstop. He would then touch everything around us, including the armrest. Each time he dug up his nose, he would grab the armrest that we shared in common. He also put his hand on my side and touched the screen, picked up something that fell and handed it to me. He was openly digging up his nose and touching everything while sniffing, indicating sickness. I was wearing a mask. He was not. I was entirely grossed out and very concerned for my health and safety. It was not a one time act, but a continuing behavior, every few minutes. I told attendants to observe his conduct too. The flight was over 12 hours long and I could not stomach this nasty behavior the long flight and risk my fragile health and safety sitting next to this man, imagine trying to eat next to him. I spoke to the flight attendants a minimum of three different times. Their eventual solution was to move me from my seat up front to the very back of the airplane, far from my colleagues. I was traveling with three companions, two sitting in front of me and one in first class. Our paid seats were the first seats behind economy preferred class. There were dozens of available seats in that section that were close to my companions and only a few feet away from the section I was sitting in that I paid for. Rather than make my health a priority and move me to a safer section, they attempted to move me to the very back of the plane. They said they couldn't say anything to the man. I didn't want to leave my companions. It was so frequent that I took evidence the entire flight to prove it. The only time he used a napkin was when they served food, and he used the one from his tray to clean his nose. That is the napkin he dropped on me, reaching over me to the stewardess. It was their jobs to help keep me safe. I was content in the seat I purchased near the front, on the aisle. I wasn't seeking to be upgraded. But if those were the only seats available, in close proximity to the seat I purchased, and still near my companions; rather than make me sit over 12 hours stressed out trying to avoid bodily fluids; put at a health & safety risk sitting next to a man openly wiping his bodily fluids on my seat, the armrest & me, they should have moved me to those seats, not the back of the plane.

17,"✅ Trip Verified | Check in desk at Montreal airport going to Philippines: We were traveling as a family with my senior mom, my wife and my infant that was 11months old. We did our check in online and made sure we chose a bulkhead seat to be able to use the basinet. To our surprise when we got to the plane they have changed our seats without letting us know. Very inconvenient and stressful since we where counting on those seats. The explanation they gave to us was that when there is a change of the type of plane they can not guarantee the seats we chose. I believe thats not a good reason to give and is a sorry excuse. If there is a change of any sort they have the responsibility to let us know I would have been glad to pay for a better seat. Morever, our return flight was even worst. At the checkein gate right before boarding,from Dubai to Montreal, they told us that we needed to check-in our carryon bags since there was no space on the overhead storage due to full capacity. We told them that we can not do so since we have an infant with us and that the carry on and baby diaper bags where a must, plus her toys,formula and food etc. They still refuse and told us we needed to check in our carry on. We were within what we were allowed to bring to the plane and still we needed to check in our things. I find this ridiculous. They do not meet the product that they are offering or selling and they have no sence of transparency at this point and a sense of understanding the situation we were in. The staff also was rude and just ignored my concerns. Not a family friendly airline thats for sure. Food and entertainment: horrible and tastless and the 2 planes going back from philippines to Dubai and transit then to Montreal my entertainement screen were broken. Staff in the plane I can clearly see that they do their best but are sometime not found when you need them, especially in a long haul flight when everyone is sleeping.

18,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have just completed a trip Johannesburg to Dallas via Dubai, returning from LAX, and cannot fault them in any way. All flights were on time, staffed by efficient, courteous staff and seats were extremely comfortable. In addition, the other services afforded by Emirates for Business Class passengers - a) the chauffeur service, which I used twice, and b) the promise of a hotel room if your layover is longer than 6 hours - mine was 9 hours - worked extremely efficiently, and I was housed at a top class hotel.",3,19th January 2024,South Africa
19,"✅ Trip Verified | I booked this airline because of the paid wifi option. It worked on the first leg of my trip (Manila to Dubai) but it didnt work at all on the 2nd leg (Dubai to Washington Dulles - 14 hours). This route to the US is longer than the Pacific route but I booked it precisely because it offered paid internet. Unluckily, the internet did not work on the longest leg. I filed a complaint to Emirates and they said that it is really not their problem and I should file a complaint to their internet service provider.",10,17th January 2024,Philippines
20,✅ Trip Verified |  The seat pockets were ripped and I was unable to store anything. When I used the tray my drink slid off bec the tray was unstable. I mentioned it to the staff but they acted like they didn't know what I was talking about. I used to regards Emirates as tops but very dissatisfied.

21,"Not Verified |   My wife and I along with 2 friends took the Emirates flight from Newark, NJ to Athens in September 2023. We had never flown on Emirates but decided to give them a try over American or Delta. The numerous tv commercials with actress Penelope Cruz has subliminally triggered something that inspired me to convince my wife and friends that we should give them a try. At the time of our ""economy"" booking we decided to pay an additional $410 per couple for seat upgrades. We had opted to pay more for the 2 seats together rather than the sitting in a row of three or fours seat in the center of the plane. As soon as we boarded the plane and took our seats I knew the outbound flight was going to be torture. The 2 seats that we paid $205 extra for were so small with walled sides and hand rests that didn't move would have been great if we were all contortionists but unfortunately we were not. We made it to Athens 10 hours later and after a couple of good nights sleep we put this horrible memory behind us so as not to ruin our 2 week long awaited vacation. About a week into the trip we did some research on the web and decided to downgrade our return seats from the same mini seats that we flew out on and instead opted for the standard seats that were in the middle section of the plane that included 4 seats. This was a great move as our return flight was much more comfortable. When I contacted Emirates upon our arrival and asked to get back the $205 paid for the return downgraded seats, their reply was that they do not issue refunds for seat downgrades. That said, the 4 of us will never travel on Emirates again. As a postscript I want to mention that none of the 4 our us, all retired and in our late 60's are heavy or have large behinds, to the contrary, we are all smaller individuals who have never had any comparable torturous seats while flying anywhere in the world. Unless you are Penolope Cruz and get complimentary ""first class"" seating or opt to pay the additional thousands of dollars, stay away from Emirates. ",3,7th January 2024,United States

The boarding areas are too small with standing too only for many, the toilets on the flights are dirty, the food is average and the seats are cramped. Earphones don't work, choice of movies has become limited. On top of that, the last two flights, they have changed the legroom seats I paid Extra for for standard seats. On complaining, I was told to ask for a refund on my return. No compensation, no upgrade (payable or not). Basically they don't care.

28,"✅ Trip Verified |  I (via a travel agent) booked a round-trip business class flight with Emirates that ended in Queenstown, NZ. Upon arriving for a layover in Melbourne at 23:30 after a 13-hour business class flight from Dubai, I was looking forward to a shower. However, I was denied entry to the Emirates lounge, without any real explanation as to why. The gentleman at the counter was more interested in making me go away than helping me understand the situation, so, confused, I called Emirates ""customer service."" They bluntly informed me that if I wanted to use the lounge so badly, my travel agent should have booked the flight from Melbourne to Queenstown on Qantas. As it turns out, the leg from Melbourne to Queenstown that I had was on Emirates partner Jetstar. As Jetstar does not have a business class cabin, this one leg (out of 5 total legs) was economy. I should note that the entire itinerary was booked through Emirates, and part of my confusion stemmed from the fact that they all had Emirates flight numbers. But what I had here was an Emirates flight operated by Jetstar (and the same flight also had a Qantas flight number - one flight, three partners, three numbers). I should have gotten the Emirates flight operated by Qantas that was departing an hour later, as Qantas has a business class cabin, and it would have been the same cost anyway. If it's the same cost anyway, why not let me come in and take a shower? It's 1am and there is no one else here. Additionally, they do not care if the arriving flight is business, or if 4/5 legs are business, you are not special.

In 2022 I had the meal issues on return journey from NRT To DXB when they could only offer a meal with items I have bad allergies to, Then second meal Cabin Crew forgot to offer, wouldn't give any water on 12.5 hour flight. for the recent one I contacted Emirates Customer Service that I have allergies for fish, mushroom and wholemeal, Customer service rep said ""bring your own food then and the crew will heat them up"" I said it will be taken off me at security at Glasgow if not Dubai"" he said no, the day came food was taken off me at Security at Glasgow. As backup they booked me a bland meal that wouldn't contain my allergies on DXB to NRT section (GLA-DXB meals were fine) which was Mushroom and second meal fish and mushroom. Which meant no food just a tiny bottle of water. I'm already worried about the return flights and worries were confirmed when once again meals offered with allergy items, Cabin crew I'll give credit concerned, very little food and water. Not just that my seat was broke, headphones broke and the so called ICE entertainment system wouldn't work, 12 hours nothing to do and crew couldn't move as they already moved others with similar problem, couldn't move myself. I recently got a response from Customer Service ""out of their control"" and one the flight cabin also said they would have refused the my own food and I wouldn't have gotten anything through Dubai for second flight. 2024 and 2025 holidays won't be with Emirates.

31,"✅ Trip Verified | I was compelled to write a review for an airline because of the exceptional service I got from the whole team of the cabin crew. It was more of a great experience rather than a journey. Right from the entrance to the aircraft I was treated like a beloved family member who came to see the family after years by every staff member. Every single request was taken seriously and was addressed to the best of the availability. I felt that I was the only special passenger for them, they were super nice and highly empathetic in their body language. The air hostess assigned to my area was asking me every single time she passed by me with a great smile if all was good. When you enter the lounge you are greeted with super smiles, if you ask them something they come close to you holding shoulders to show attachment. They were all super devoted to their work, full of energy and trying to help everyone as much they can.

34,"Not Verified |  When is extra leg room, extra leg room. 11 of us travelled on Emirates from Bham to Dubai/Sydney 28 October 23 and returned 16 Nov back into Bham EK0039 flight. We paid for extra leg room seats 80J K H so that we could relax and have sleep on the long journeys ahead of us. On 3 of the trips the air stewards were respectful of our space, given we were next to where they served the food and drinks with their trolleys. They were all quiet during the long flights once drinks and food had been served so myself, husband and son could sleep. However, on the flight from Dubai to Bham this could not be a worse experience if Emirates tried. The team were inexperienced (bar one professional) one of them swearing so we could hear F""** word as the curtains were left open, explaining what she required in men. The food and drinks trolley was left next to my husband within an inch of his feet so they stepped over him each time, apologising for waking him up over the next 3 hours. A team of 6 stood in our area having a meeting. After 4 hours into the 8 hr flight, I politely asked if they could move the trolley so we were not disturbed and it was really disrespectful given we had paid extra for the seat. The deputy and mgr came to see us to apologise and talk to their team and moved the trolley. I showed the mgr a picture. The mgr took my phone and email details to formally respond, but 9 days later still no response. Very disappointing, given 11 of us travelled. The previous 3 flights were really good.",9,28th November 2023,United Kingdom
35,✅ Trip Verified | This was a short but wonderful fifth freedom ride with Emirates. Despite the fairly short (just under 3 hours) flight Emirates was at the top of their game. Most of what I experienced has been documented many times but the personalized service I received was notable. A delicious meal was artfully served and no request was too much for the crew. A quick walk back to the lounge shared with business class was fun including light conversation with the bartender. Flight was on time and the mounted cameras were a fun way to watch the landing.,2,9th November 2023,United States

Seats relatively comfortable and cabin service OK but struggled to find something interesting to watch on IFE on all 4 sectors - that's why I always travel with a book - although watching Newcastle Utd hammer PSG at St James' Park live was a bonus on BNE-DXB sector. Unfortunately there was no wifi or ""live"" TV coverage on DXB-BNE return sector for which the crew apologised before departing DXB. Relatively uneventful flights that arrived & departed pretty much on time other than a 1hr delay on take off from DXB on final leg - pushed back from gate on time but held on ground for an hour due to ATC ""traffic"". Emirates actually provide a good ""one stop"" service from the east coast of Australia to Europe but the 14hr legs to & from DXB can be a struggle. Overall 7/10 and I would use again.",10,9th November 2023,Australia
37,"Not Verified |  I've always loved the Emirates A380 as a comfortable plane to fly but the Business Class cabin is simply too big for the crew and galley capacity, This was a late night departure from LHR where many passengers skipped the meal in favour of sleep, yet for those of us wishing to dine, it took over three hours to complete the service. The crew were inattentive and disinterested, just bringing up a course and then disappearing until they brought the next. It was Economy service with only slightly better food. The smaller cabin in the 777 leg was better service but a much poorer cabin experience. Very difficult in the middle seats, to relax and watch a film when your screen is right next to your neighbour's.",7,31st October 2023,United Kingdom

Lo and behold the saver tickets were released a week later making the price £600 cheaper. Emirates refuse to help, their excuse was all these people of 8 different flights had cancelled, therefore making the business saver available! It’s price rigging. Get everyone to buy the more expensive price, then sell the cheaper ones. They are a great airline until anything goes wrong. I can rebook the cheaper flight but it costs me £500 to cancel.

However, they won’t change to one row before which 17 because all they care is selling the seats instead of passenger’s convenience. Also during 50 mins of turbulence they only allow business class passengers use the toilet and the whole economic class passengers were not allowed. Only BC PAXs have the skill to protect themself during turbulence and EC PAXs can’t do it? I wrote a complaints and they responded that I have accepted the alternative seat but actually I went to original seat which the screen was broken (including call button).

40,"Not Verified | Emirates is an excellent airline, Excellent planes, excellent service, however, they should know that they are servicing all kind of people. On my flight they served Indian food only, when asked why can't I get other kind of food, I was told the this route serves about 65 percent Indian customers, what about the other 35 percent, I asked, got no answer or simply, they can go to hell. My only suitcase didn't arrive With me at my final distinction, they forgot it in Dubai, this is not the Emirates that was 10 years ago, it shouldn't use the logo ""fly better"" it should now have another logo that say ""Lose weight while flying Emirates"" since you will not eat for 36 hours on your round trip",3,18th October 2023,United States
41,"✅ Trip Verified |   First I was separated from my wife of 35 years and then despite my plea of a stiff shoulder I was given a window seat in all my 42 years of flying. Emirates seem to treat its tour group passengers as 2nd class passengers without any rights. My wife and I flew to Spain and Portugal from Singapore on a packaged tour with a travel group. On our return flights first from Madrid to Dubai on EK142 on 9 Oct 2023 and from Dubai to Singapore on EK 354 on 10 Oct 2023, my wife and I were placed on window seats on the opposite sides of the aircraft. When I enquired at the check in counter for an aisle seat for the 2 flights as I am a tall bloke with a stiff shoulder (which has been affecting me for the past 5 years), the staff gave me an aisle seat further back and my wife in a window seat 6 rows ahead. She said she tried but could not see the connecting flight seating plan from Dubai to Singapore and advised me to approach the boarding gate in Dubai for help. When we reached Dubai, the tour manager, my wife and I, another another couple who had been in opposite ends of the aircraft made a beeline for the connecting help desk close to B18 boarding gate. The guard refused to let us into the queue even though there was no one queuing and the 2 counter staff were helping a couple of the passengers at the counter. He told us to use the self-help kiosk computer even though we said we needed help with changing the seats. The computer did not do the latter and directed back to the counter. The guard was still reluctant and finally allowed my wife and I in the queue. However, our tour manager and the couple were kept outside the line even though they had legitimate business to speak to someone at the counter. There was a couple talking to a group of the staff outside the counter near the queue and the man was gesticulating wildly in a heated discussion with the staff. Eventually one of the staff involved in the 'conversation' told the guard to admit all of us and 'royally allowed' us to talk to him behind the counter. He told us in no uncertain terms that we were given our seats as 'non-paying' passengers and it was tough luck that we had to be separated. Our tour manager protested that the tour passenger list with familial/partnering connections was given to the airline beforehand but he said we were given a block of seats from rows 81 to 83 and he could not help in any way. My question to the airline is this: if the passenger list has been provided with the different familial/partnering groupings could it not be more accommodating and doing a slipshod job of seating willy nilly without regard for the families and couples travelling together. What happens if there are families with young children? Furthermore if the airline has given a block of seats (say rows 61 to 63 or 81 to 83 and not all window seats or not all middle seats) in advance why can't it have the good sense to pass them on the tour manager beforehand so the tour manager can help to allocate the seats according to the passengers' preference and needs? Even in times of profit squeeze when corporations try to extract every cent from its passengers, how much money can you make to justify discriminating and alienating your passengers just because the 25 of them are travelling as part of a package tour?",7,12th October 2023,Singapore
42,"✅ Trip Verified |   I wish to express my dissatisfaction with my recent experience on Emirates Flight EK2185, scheduled for August 6th, 2023, from Dubai to Catania. The flight was canceled less than 24 hours in advance, which severely impacted my long-haul trip. This trip was booked through the Emirates website and was disrupted just hours before its departure due to the cited 'unforeseen circumstances,' namely a fire at Catania Airport, which had occurred three weeks prior. Being an aware passenger, I was cognizant of the previous flight cancellations to Catania and the airport's incapacity to handle extra-Schengen flights. Consequently, I had been diligently monitoring the situation, investing significant time and financial resources from a remote location in South Africa to stay updated and explore alternative travel options in case of an eventual cancellation. My distressing experience began when I found myself caught in a bureaucratic game of ping-pong between Emirates and Flydubai, the airline operating the flight. Both carriers appeared to evade responsibility and failed to offer me any practical alternative plans. The cancellation notification reached me while I was en route to the airport, necessitating an unscheduled stop in an area with phone reception to contact the Emirates call center, as per Flydubai's app recommendation. To my dismay, I spent over 30 minutes on the phone only to discover that Emirates was not presenting any viable options for reaching my final destination. Furthermore, their communication regarding alternative flights from Dubai to Italy was initially unclear—mentioning Rome or Milan—and later, limited to Naples, with no apparent connection to Catania. It was only after a protracted discussion that the call-center operator finally intervened, reconfiguring my entire reservation to a flight bound for Milan, just an hour before my scheduled check-in at Skukuza. This change, which was seemingly necessitated by Emirates' arcane policies, left me in Dubai without compensation for the additional time spent there. I was accommodated in a shared room with no meals, a circumstance that I managed to secure solely because my partner already had a reservation for a Dubai Connect service. Following the call-center operator's instructions, I had to personally book a new flight from Milan to Catania, incurring additional expenses. The overwhelming stress and uncertainty surrounding this ordeal marred a significant portion of my holiday experience. I requested that Emirates recognized the hardships I endured during this journey, including the extra costs incurred due to the days of delay and the missed medical appointment. However, they just said they could do nothing.",3,8th October 2023,Italy

She went ahead to check in my luggage bag and assigned me my seat, 38E. I was shocked and told her I've got a confirmation email that seat 32A was allocated to me (yes, I booked for it in advance using Trip.com). She said it's a 3rd party confirmation and I was supposed to online check in. Gosh... that was ridiculous! You mean an email confirmation is not a confirmation? Fine. I told her I do not mind an aisle seat instead but do not put me in the middle. She made a call and ended up telling me that it cannot be done.

45,"✅ Trip Verified | I had a poor experience on this flight. I have been using Emirates' services for over 20 years, being a Blue member and, then, a Silver member, up until the time of covid. I have had no reason to complain, previously about Emirates’ service. Sitting in seat 30F, I had ordered vegetarian food, and received a snack soon after take-off, along with a sealed cup of water. Subsequently, meals for other passengers were brought round and people were offered drinks, but I was offered nothing, and the steward moved on too quickly for me to request a drink. At the next opportunity, when a steward passed by, I requested a drink, but was advised to wait until lunch was served (a very poor response, I felt). I reiterated: I would like a drink as soon as possible (as I was thirsty). The person in seat 30G was asleep and I could not exit the seat with causing a disturbance. A drink was subsequently provided (but over 15 minutes later). However, the table in 30F is/was not secure and the drink slid off, spilled over me and the person in 30G next to me. The people sitting either side of me were more helpful than the steward in trying to clear up the mess. Later on, lunch did arrive, but it was 2 hours after I had first requested a drink (so, my request for a drink had been vindicated). When food trays were later collected, mine was overlooked, the steward passed me by, and my food tray was left for over half an hour. When a steward passed by, I asked that the tray be removed and could not understand why I was being treated in what seemed a negligent manner. At this point, I was beginning to become very fed up. A supervisor later came round and asked if I was alright. I was fine (albeit tired), but frustrated at having been ignored and overlooked. The supervisor was firm, but unapologetic, and asked me if I needed anything. I did not need anything, and she left me without further comment, her enquiry appearing pointless to me, as it solved nothing. Following this experience, I am unlikely to use Emirates again, which has left me thoroughly disillusioned with the company.",5,22nd September 2023,United Kingdom

48,"✅ Trip Verified | I made a single reservation with Emirates to fly from Milan to Botswana, via Dubai and Johannesburg. The two flights to and from Botswana were operated by other airlines. On my way to Botswana I made a transit in Dubai and a transit in Johannesburg. On my way back things went bad. We arrived at the airport in Botswana (Maun) and the flight we booked on the Emirates website, was not present. We asked and found out that it had been replaced by another flight, operated by a different airline, at a different time. We checked in for this new flight and found out that no transit was possible in Johannesburg. Therefore we had to go through immigration, retrieve our luggage, queue again for the check in, pass security and passport control to get on our next flight to Dubai. To me it's unbelievable that Emirates did not care to inform us about the flight change and the fact that we could not make a normal transit, like on the first part of our journey. It's a pity because the flight experience has been good, with very nice crew and operating on time.",1,11th September 2023,Italy
49,"✅ Trip Verified |  The return journey from HKG to BKK reaffirmed the low quality of the airline that I experienced on the outward journey. Added to that however, was the 50 minutes to queue in the Online Check-in, having arrived at the airport more than the recommended 3 hours before flight departure. This is presumably as a result of only 2 check-in counters open for Online check-in. 2 were available for those who had not checked in, and these seemed to move more quickly. Once through, and with enough time to grab a bite at the airport, the greeting on board was initially friendly, but then the surly attitude of any staff with whom I came into any brief contact, (one, who removed my light hand luggage with laptop, to accommodate a passenger at the Emergency Exit, who's steamer trunk ""hand luggage"" could not fit into the overhead luggage bin above his seat, (which Emirates call ""hat rack""; if only). I had heard Emirates were the best on offer in this post pandemic era, but if that is the case, the standard must be extremely low. So low, a low-cost airline would make more sense.

The service was perfunctory at best. My expectations were low regarding most aspects of the flight, and I was not disappointed, but I had read that service was good quality with pleasant staff.

The cabin crews took all their times to serve the foods. Some passengers are served first then after hours the rest of the passengers are served. They also served the beverages or the drinks late after the meals. Me and families never got a drink or any beverage at all. I phoned the crews so many times but they never attended us. When I complained to the crew she apologised and promised to bring us some drinks but she never appeared. On our way from Mauritius to dubai in flight EK 704 we got seats which were close to the toilet the floor was wet because of leak. Inform the crew and they took ages to bring a blanket to cover the floor. During the flights the cabin crews supposed to served drinks water or juice but they didn't. They look disinterested to provide a good service. They pulled the curtain so that you can't see them and they themselves eating and drinking. A lots have changed.

Despite being very polite, ground staff appeared disinterested in assisting for an upgrade both in Durban & Dubai and even their call centre. It was at least 2 hours into the first flight before we had either a drink or food and in 47B by then there was no more food choice. Compared to the other carrier I took south-bound to South Africa, screen on our Emirates B777 to Dubai was old and headphones on both flights uncomfortable.

And then, I requested a refund in July 2023 and got emailed back from Emirates. They confirmed that the refund had been approved to Amex (my original payment card). I contacted Amex 10 working days later, and was told that Amex not received the refund. Amex had to fill a form to raise the case for investigation but they need details on ""the refund amount"".

Similarly, on my return flight, the extended delay left me feeling frustrated and exhausted. Upon my return to Dubai, the baggage retrieval process took an exorbitant amount of time.

But now that I want to book the free hotel night, I got the feedback: ""On reading the last line on the terms and conditions, you see the statement says ""The ticket must be issued on an Emirates (176) document.""

62,"✅ Trip Verified |  The issues I encountered include a significant problem with their cancellation policy, lack of responsiveness from their customer service team, concerning safety practices, refusal to reimburse for damaged luggage, an extensive delay during the return flight, and a stark contrast in service quality between Economy and Business class. Regarding the cancellation policy, I received misleading information from three representatives, who assured me that I would receive a full refund if I canceled within 24 hours. However, they failed to mention the crucial condition that this only applied when the flight was at least 7 days after the initial booking. As a result, I tried to cancel within the 24-hour window but could only reschedule. This cost me a $500 loss vs. the option of cancelling and booking a new flight for the following day. Despite Emirates acknowledging in writing their mistake, they repeatedly refused to provide a price match or refund, and eventually even stopped replying to my follow up messages on the open complain. The lack of responsiveness from Emirates compounded my frustration. Numerous follow-up messages went unanswered, showing a lack of interest in resolving the issues I faced.  During the flight, I was alarmed by a safety practice where all blankets were collected and piled in front of the emergency exits.  Emirates also declined to reimburse me for one of two damaged pieces of luggage, despite the damage occurring during their handling.  Furthermore, the return flight experienced a significant delay for a missing document, resulting in passengers being seated on the plane for over two hours, including boarding time. Despite the delay being just a few minutes short of two hours, the lack of updates, assistance, and provisions such as free Wi-Fi or refreshments left passengers feeling inconvenienced and neglected. The service quality and care for Economy class travelers fall short of expectations. ",2,16th July 2023,United States

The check-in was also poor. I followed the check in signs for economy seats at Dubai airport T3, waited for around 20-30 mins before being told to check in at desk 5 (flights to USA) - i wasn't flying to the USA, how am i supposed to know to follow that sign?

66,"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm writing this review so others won't go through what went through. This airline has no accountability whatsoever. The day of my flight I was denied check in. The reason was that I had less than 6 month validity on my passport which was not required for my destination. The Emirates agent at the check-in booth told me he wouldn't let me on the flight and then offered my seat to a standby client. Because of this I missed my flight, I had to renew my passeport in less than 24h and lost 2 days stay at the hotel. I had to pay 300$+ ticket as penalty to board on the next flight not to mention the psychological distress I was put under (I have depression/anxiety disorder). I was travelling with a group and someone in my group has checked in with no problem with passport validity less than 6 months. When I contacted Emirates for refund they said the agent didn't declare the incident and put me as no show on the system although I was there in time with the group. I was told by Emirates that without the name of the agent they can do nothing about it. In short Emirates agents can freely deny you your flight manipulate the system and sell your seat to another person and you can do nothing about it.",5,4th July 2023,Tunisia

Flight it’s self was good but due to midnight departure staff were just going through the motions. The beef tenderloin has to be the driest toughest piece of meat to have ever been served on an airplane. Overall I have had better experiences on other carriers. Emirates seems to suffer from hit and miss crew. Plane landed on time and for the price the service was not unreasonable. Still a bit poor that you don’t even get a limited amount of wifi in business class.",1,4th July 2023,Germany

Instead of giving four seat configuration. Never happened before. The folks at gate terminals very unsupportive and not even willing to listen to you. One word is what they say full flight. Would never ever fly back on this. Yes am skywards members as well, but that doesn't help you as well.",6,29th June 2023,United States
69,"✅ Trip Verified |  I decided to fly Emirates again after having a very unfortunate first experience with them a few years ago. Well what I can tell now from 4 flights with them is that they are a hit or miss airline. Some crew members will be friendly and professional others on the same flight will be rude and careless. What others have mentioned on these reviews is true, they will run out of meals option easily and you will have to settle with leftovers if you are seated at the rear. I have noticed the aircrafts are becoming very overused, some had broken features and a funny smell. The food is very basic if compared to other premium airlines. I would say Emirates is still a viable option if the price is right and they offer a lot of connections, but they are not my first choice airlines if other middle eastern carriers are in the game.",1,29th June 2023,Brazil
70,"✅ Trip Verified | My family experienced very poor service with Emirates, the issue was with food services, on a 16 hour flight, we get no meal selection, just have to satisfy with leftovers, we were sitting in row 86, 1st time flight attendant says they only have vegetarian meals, ran out of non-vegetarian, the same thing happens at the second meal, also on second time no beverages were served, I had call a flight attendant for beverage service. Not enough time was given to eat our food. May be Emirates would ask customers on their meal preference and stock up accordingly, no beverage services offered at all during the entire flight, we would have to walk up to the service station and ask for water/juice. Hope to see improved services on future Emirates flights.",7,26th June 2023,United States

72,"✅ Trip Verified |  I'm motivated to write this critical review after multiple phone-hours with customer service agents with Emirates in the hope that others would benefit (and that Emirates would listen!). We had booked a return flight from/to STL-COK via YYZ and DXB. The first flight from STL to YYZ was by its code share partner Air Canada. Unfortunately, just a couple weeks before our flight, Air Canada changed the flight time such that it was not possible to catch the flight from YYZ to DXB. We reached out to Emirates, our primary booking partner, to rebook and were provided a rerouting option through ORD (Chicago) for an additional $3300 for 3 tickets. Annoyed by this suggestion, we requested to fly Air Canada flight the day before, which was turned down because of unavailability of economy class tickets. Because of lack of viable options, we decided to drop the flight from STL-YYZ but retain the flights from YYZ-DXB and DXB-COK, with the idea of booking our own flights from STL-YYZ. We booked this flight for the day before, so we also had to book overnight stay in YYZ. When we filed a travel claim which needed a certificate of flight delay, Emirates asked me to reach out to Air Canada. Unfortunately, Air Canada had none of our names in their system and it was impossible to reach their customer service for further assistance. In summary, we have spent almost $2800 (flight tickets + overnight stay) for Air Canada/Emirates' incompetence and are unable to get a 'flight delayed' certificate to process our legitimate claim. Please beware when booking flights through Emirates because it takes absolutely NO responsibility for their code share partners' mistakes. All I received were platitudes such as, 'we understand', 'that is awful', etc. over the phone but with no real help to process our claim. Lesson learned and no more Emirates for us ever!",9,24th June 2023,United States
73,"✅ Trip Verified |  Excellent service. I flew Dubai- B'Ham- Dubai in economy class. Emirates has common counters where you can check in your luggage. Initially, I was skeptical (particularly on the DXB-BHX route) but Emirates made no mistakes. This is quite convenient as you can check in quickly and go to the lounge. The flight departed on time, the crew had a smile and were quite professional. Food was sufficient in quantity and quite good with metal cutlery in economy class. There was another snack service followed by juices/hot drinks 1.5 hours before landing. The seating is quite good and has a seat [pitch of 32""). B777s in use by Emirates are getting old and you can see the signs. Their ICE system was excellent. I am not sure I would like the Business class seats here as they weren't lie-flat but I was flying economy. Families with kids were well taken care of with flight attendants distributing amenities and offering to take and share instant pictures using Polaroid cameras. The in-flight wifi was free for text messaging using WhatsApp, even in economy if you have Skywards membership. My only complaint during the trip is that the plane was parked far off and required considerable walking at Terminal 3 in Dubai to reach immigration (which was a breeze). Overall, it was a great experience but flights are quite expensive compared to the competition.",1,24th June 2023,United Arab Emirates
74,"✅ Trip Verified | What a disappointment. Emirates is lauded as having one of the best inflight experiences in the world. They obviously spend a lot of money marketing the experience as such. The problem with this is that expectations are high. The hard product is good, all be it a little tatty. Service and food quality is poor. Options are limited and there is no dining in demand. It’s the first time I’ve flown business and had my meal served on a tray. Never addressed or welcomed by name aside from when my boarding card was presented on entering the aircraft. Crew were polite when you got their attention, but most of the time they were avoiding eye contact when racing through the cabin. I had just come off a Virgin Atlantic upper class flight and while their upper class seats aren’t great, the service blows emirates out of the water. Fly better? Do better!!",9,17th June 2023,United Kingdom

I reserved two tickets 3 months ago and just 5 days before the flight, I found that the reservation was cancelled automatically because my bank refused the payment at the time of buying. So during these 3 months I didn't receive any email or message that notify me about this. The only email that I got it says "" Reservation confirmed"". I was really shocked when they told me that I can't find my reservation because it was already cancelled by the system automatically without any notification. After all, they kept blaming me why I didn't check my bank account every day. I have to pay extra 400 euros to book another flight in order to get home in time. Really sad, angry and helpless.",4,13th June 2023,Belgium
76,"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates is an airline that tries to maximize the amount of money that it can squeeze out of customers, whilst providing the minimum possible service. I find them far less flexible than other airlines, will apply every penalty they can regardless of circumstance, and will not let customers know of the complimentary services they provide so you end up paying extra. The counter staff are generally unhelpful and impatient, and the cabin crew are less professional and appear less trained than other airlines. Definitely would NOT recommend flying with Emirates to anyone. I will certainly never fly with them again.",1,10th June 2023,Australia

79,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the worst experience of my lifetime flying with Emirates. It all started from Thiruvananthapuram where our travel began, food was just pathetic and the service is just awful. Let alone the seats are not even comfortable with hardly any legroom. Sitting on the seat for less than an hour and you feel your bones crushing on the frame of the seat. The flight attendants seem like overly busy even if they were to walk past you and you ask them for a glass of water. The next leg was the long haul. Both my wife and I were just exhausted with the service and the flight attendants wouldn't even get a band aid after I cut myself from hitting my feet on the fasteners of the seat.  We waited for almost an hr after boarding from Dubai to take off and I ended up cutting myself while being seated and I showed my feet to the flight attendant, and she didn't even care to get back to me until my wife had to address it 48 minutes later.  The seats are as poor as the first leg. How do you expect customers to sit in these seats for such long-haul flights. No legroom and the people in front when they recline the seat your stuck with the tray on your diaphragm. I seriously dreaded the flight and the attendants as well. There was a lot of overhead Cabin baggage space where she could open and look but instead just chose to stand where she was and asked me if she could move my bag. Then when another passenger had to get his bag up, she asks my wife if the bag was hers and it was the bag of the passenger behind us. She was like it's my bag and leave it there and then the flight attendant got back to us and asked my wife to move her bag and I said no. Why don't you move the other bag instead. She didn't even have the courtesy to look for other bins if it wasn't full. But just stood in her vicinity to put the bag in and get the job done. I don't understand why do these kind of staff even work. Going to TRV via Dubai the men flight attendants were just so rude that they act like they are doing you a favor by getting you a glass of water. They asked if there's anything else like it was a big, huge task for them to get a glass of water. Juice/water/fruits ??",10,31st May 2023,United States

The cabin crew is very nice and welcoming.",1,29th May 2023,Portugal

82,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had the misfortune of booking a flight on Emirates for my daughter to fly as an unaccompanied minor. All flights were expensive so I used an app to find some cheaper flights and booked on line. I must mention that I checked with their terms and conditions to make sure I could call and change the flight to an unaccompanied minor. Firstly I never received the itinerary so I called Emirates to get this sent. Secondly I could barely understand the operator as he mumbled and had a strong accent. Once I had the itinerary I then told them I needed the unaccompanied minor added. Because I had booked flights operated by Emirates but run by Qantas, I needed to call Qantas to make the change. So I called Qantas, they had no record of the flights, then told me I need to change through the airline I booked. I called Emirates again and explained, they then said I assure you it needs to be done by Qantas. I went back and forth from airline to airline multiple times until Emirates then said there is no way I can change to unaccompanied minor and Qantas would not change it either, I finally had enough and asked to speak to someone who knew what they were doing. I spoke to a supervisor who was not rude or anything but stated I’d need to cancel the flight, take the hit and rebook via phone. I don’t think so, referring to their website that says booking electronically then adding a service is perfectly acceptable. So now I have return tickets in my daughters name that we can’t use. This is bordering on criminal if not unethical, Airlines are supposed to be helpful not members of the “Wit” family",10,25th May 2023,New Zealand

86,"Not Verified |  I strongly recommend flying with a different airline if you have an infant. Emirates are not what they used to be and their customer care is horrific. I booked a bassinet for my baby which means booking a middle seat. I booked 3 months in advance so I had the pick of any seat, yet I checked the requirements for a bassinet and was confident I would be allowed one. Obviously for my baby to have a bassinet was more important than me having a comfortable seat so the sacrifice was made and I chose a seat with a bassinet. Upon boarding I was told my baby was too big for a bassinet. I told them she meets the height and weight requirements but they insisted she was too big. They told me if a baby is capable of reaching the bottom of the bassinet they could push out the press studs and collapse the bassinet, implying that only babies who don’t move in their sleep are able to use a bassinet. This left me in complete distress knowing I had 15 hours ahead of me with my infant on my knee on a front row middle seat. I was in a fit of tears and the flight attendant said sorry there’s nothing I can do. Our flight was at 9pm so I had already been awake all day and had no sleep the whole flight. I couldn’t eat because the fold out tray from the chair arm wouldn’t fit in front of me and my baby and the one time she was asleep my meal had two hairs in it. I was so upset I just gave them my tray back (to which they huffed at me for having to take it when they weren’t ready) and didn’t eat for the journey. I then had a 3 hour wait in Dubai before another 7 hour flight. I asked if I could change this seat and they said no the flights was full which caused me to have a panic attack and almost faint after no food or sleep for a very long time. No one attended to me except one passenger and we had to get on the plane and sit in a middle seat for another 7 hours with no sleep. There was a nice attendant on the second flight who allowed me to stand up and eat a danish while my baby slept on my chair.

In both my flights, from London to Dubai and Dubai to Phuket I had same issues with the seat. First seats are low quality shakes wiggles a lot and offers low comfort. Only good thing was leg space. In both flights infotainment system was broken. Cabin crew tried numerous resets which took 30mins each. On the 4th reset both times it worked but then suddenly while watching it stopped working again. They didn't even offer another seat and there was available options. This is crazy! Absolutely worse service and customer support ever. They have no vegetarian option. They only had Indian vegetarian option which is completely different and tailored for Indian cuisine. I would expect them to just change the main dish on the regular meal right but no! They brought vegetarian meal long before everyone else but didn't offer a drink. Cabin crew is always busy at the back and hard to get anything. They didn't offer socks, travel package. Just blanket and small pillow. I did fly with etihad, Quatar airways and Turkish airlines.

There were few passengers who had same problem because they told us to stay in our homes and didn't even have new flight to travel the following day. After endless number of calls, we got refund and booked Qatar airways with the same amount but as we booked the previous day,the ticket charge costed 1 lakh something more.

The flights between Sydney and Dubai were in the new Premium Economy Class, sadly not yet available between Dubai and Prague. The economy class legs of the journey were satisfactory given they were only 6 hours in duration. However the Premium Economy flights were definitely a significant improvement, and in my opinion well worth the extra expense. Bright cabin with wide comfortable seats, excellent service, improved food quality and presentation and the bathrooms in a different league from the economy class product. In every way using Premium Economy class greatly improved my travel experience and turned the long journey into something enjoyable, rather than an endurance test. My hope is that this product can be rolled out to more routes in the near future.

Both the other FAs on separate occasions when approaching to serve us, had apologised and began to excuse their busy schedule but was unable to advise why they did not call for additional assistance. I spoke to a senior attendant, who apologised and advised the approach taken is not protocol and should not have happened.",4,2nd April 2023,United Kingdom
108,"✅ Trip Verified |  So we paid £4K for 4 tickets to be upgraded to business class, the family wanted to try it out so I thought let’s do it. We checked in at the business class dedicated desk and were advised by the Emirates staff to proceed to gate 7 where we will find the lounge. Hand tickets over and told you don’t have access, no explanation just handed back by some power enjoying jobs worth with no options offered. I was stunned. Checked Emirates website and it clearly states our class of travel has lounge access. This is very frustrating and an underhanded approach from Emirates. Turns out this is correct, but why on earth don’t you train staff to explain this or clearly print on the ticket / emailed ticket / purchase confirmation. This must cause so many issues at the airport for people. You buy business class tickets you always get the lounge - so I thought. A very poor decision on Emirates behalf if you ask me. What a disappointment.",9,1st April 2023,United Kingdom
109,"✅ Trip Verified |  Coming from Orlando on a very long flight, the plan departed 2h late and landed late, which caused missing our connection. I have travelled with 2 kids so coming from a 12h long flight and being greeted with a voucher for few meals preselected by airlines (like an apple and tomato sandwich, banana and noodle soup…things that are super unpleasant for kids to start with) super cheap offering and I have to get stuck for almost 5h on the airport with two extremely tired kids with no comfort and proper food due to airline mistake. When I asked the customer support desk to arrange for us at least a lounge or upgrade (min expected from them ), he was so rude and said this is “the best” he will offer and turned his back. So I was extremely disappointed to experience such a treatment from such an airline, they don’t take responsibility to what is their mistake and my feedback is not bothering them at all. The real Emirates service is not the one they advertise to hook you up!",1,29th March 2023,Kuwait
110,"Not Verified |  My experience onboard Emirates was a good one. The IFE was great, food was good and so was the cabin service. The airline though sent a 777 with the old cabin from Bengaluru to Dubai, which was not so bad, but made me a bit disappointed. The next flight from Dubai to Washington DC also was served by a Boeing 777, but with the latest cabin with a new, big, modern IFE screen and a brighter cabin, which made a difference for the better. Apart from the old cabin, I found the legroom to be quite a bit lesser than what I initially thought. Perhaps I should try the Airbus A380 if I am to get a better experience. But the 777s were also equally nice, at least in Economy. Since I was flying during Covid time, I was also a tad bit disappointed over no hot towels and menu cards in Economy. Overall, I would definitely recommend this airline.",2,25th March 2023,India

The A380-800 is a great plane to fly, plenty of seat and leg room and alo very quiet. The 2nd journey was completely different, the Boeing 777-300er was old, very narrow with limited leg room, the engines were loud,t he comment ‘cattle class‘ comes to mind, there was a vietnamese couple sat next to me, the crew thought i was with them and handed me the same meal & drinks as them, luckily i wanted the same meal as them, she then realised that we were not together when i spoke and asked for a different drink.

To do so, they wasted my time, asked me to stand on the side and made me go and talk to lot of different people. They argue that I can not have hand carry bag and laptop bag separately. To make the situation worst another ground staff at the time of entering plane stopped me and pressurized me to board the plane with just laptop bag (which anyway going to be in my legroom).  On many occasions, I paid extra and chose Emirates for the service and comfort which seems to be a thing of a past. From now on I will never choose Emirates if I have an option.",5,14th March 2023,Australia
116,Not Verified |  This was a nightmare and the most horrible airline I’ve ever taken in my life. Unfriendly staff. Customer care is zero. Whatever I asked for wasn’t done. I needed my seat switched so the crew told me to go look for a seat. Passengers were pretty annoyed of me asking around when she should’ve done that herself to avoid this. Asked for couple things it’s either not available like (tissues) or a mask? Food is terrible. Flight was late so now I will be missing my connection.,1,10th March 2023,United States
117,✅ Trip Verified |  On the Emirates return flight from Kolkata there was no option to pay for extra baggage during online check in even though the Emirates website mentions that passengers should be paying for extra baggage during check in to save money. The option to do so was greyed out and unavailable. I ended up paying the equivalent to $270.00 CAD for 1 extra luggage at the Emirates counter at the airport during baggage drop off. I called Emirates to complain and the customer service said it’s because it is a connecting flight from Kolkata and that option is not available. It shouldn't matter because i paid only $100 CAD during the Air Canada check in to Dubai for a stop over on the way to Kolkata. On top of that Emirates didn't update me by email or text messages after online check in. I think Emirates has really bad customer service and I will never fly with this airline again.,1,1st March 2023,Canada

119,"Not Verified |  Overrated airline. This was my first flight with Emirates after having heard so much hype about it for many years now. Previously I have flown with Qatar airways on the same route. Cons: Terrible seating, very cramped and narrow, not enough space to even move feet. Very little quantity of food - hardly 2-3 spoons of 3 items each, plus bun and butter. Water/drinks served only twice in 6.5 hour flight. No response despite pressing button for assistance.

120,"✅ Trip Verified |  In December 2022 I travelled from Sydney to Dubai with Emirates First Class. I was contacted by the Emirates car transfer company prior to collection and informed them the number of passengers and luggage, but the car that arrived was too small and the driver was rude and unhelpful. Check-in was ok, but was not given an express pass and was directed to the business lounge not first class as available for gold members. At boarding time most of the other passengers from economy were boarded before the priority boarding due to lack of staff at the gates. After boarding I asked for my meal after take off but after 1.5 hours nothing had arrived I had to call twice before someone came to me, it took nearly another 20 min before I got my meal, As my teenage children were flying in Premier economy, I checked on them but on both occasions was rudely told to return to seat my by the same cabin crew member and on the second occasion was questioned about my seat, this was totally embarrassing. After landing in Dubai I was not able to enter the first-class lounge unless I paid $420.00 for my son for 20 min, my sons airmiles were missing at the end of the trip. I complained to Emirates about the service and after 8 weeks was told the transfer company was a third party, boarding was a strict policy, that it was my fault not to help myself to some sandwiches, policy on lounge entry, and that my son was not an air miles member (he is), No apology or mention of the cabin crew behaviour, after responding to their response I basically told by them basically Emirates did not care about my business (over $250k) per year. Totally not worth the money or air miles.",5,25th February 2023,Australia
121,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was quite disappointed given how much I paid for the ticket. I had a business trip in Hong Kong and I returned from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The airport was huge but the Emirates ground service was very poor. There was some issues at the check in counter causing me to wait at least half hour for my turn to check in luggage. The seats at the economy class is good, on par with other airlines. The cabin crews are nice and helpful and it seems the cabin crew are all coming from different countries but I don't any Emirati or Middle Eastern cabin crew. I wish there are more Asian food options (I'm Thai) on food instead of Middle Eastern/Arabic food. The inflight entertainment was okay, nothing surprising. With the whole flight experience, I think it is not value for money. Will take other airlines next time instead.",2,25th February 2023,Hong Kong
122,"✅ Trip Verified |  Absolutely atrocious service of the ground staff and call center staff. I was denied boarding by their check-in staff, because I had some minor marks on my passport. The staff kept listing out the 'rules' and 'terms and conditions', and even when I asked for some solutions it was back to the rules; literally no insights When I asked about re-booking it's 'we can't help, you need to contact your travel agent'. The staff showed no compassion and provided no useful advice. I had a return flight; my outgoing flight was from London to India, then my return flight was Bahrain to London. They listed me as a 'no-show' on their 'system' - which means they also canceled my Bahrain - London flight, which I can easily make (I will get a new passport in 2 days' time) and then fly to India to continue my trip as planned (minus a few days). To get on that flight from Bahrain to London I have to pay a 200GBP 'change fee' and the difference in fare - for a flight that I have already paid for, and that I would have made.

127,"✅ Trip Verified |  After being a Skywards member for many years, this time I requested wheelchair assistance. I flew Bangkok to Cape Town and returned from Johannesburg to Bangkok. I was expecting the wheelchair transfers in Dubai to be the usual high standard. Instead of a wheelchair waiting for me as the aircraft opened its doors in Dubai, I was told to walk along the sky bridge and to find a desk that would then provide a wheelchair. I did this and found a group of men who were obviously employed to provide wheelchair assistance standing around talking to each other and did not seem to have any list of passengers who required this assistance. I was told there were not enough wheelchairs and told to walk to another area where there was no seating and I had to stand until an assistant arrived with a wheelchair. I sat in this while we went from one building to another and in the airport train. I was unceremoniously dumped at the seating area at the gate and a very long walk down a corridor and onto the skybridge awaited me. The woman sitting next to me kindly asked it I would like to lean on her arm as we traversed this onto the aircraft. I don't know what would have happened if I had been unable to walk at all. The return trip from Johannesburg to Bangkok was even worse. When we landed in Dubai there were no wheelchairs and I was asked to walk a long distance and up an escalator to an area of seating and told to wait for a golf cart. This did not appear. I was sitting next to a woman whose mobility was even worse than mine and she was in a great deal of pain. We were then told we had to walk to some other area, so the woman and I shuffled off leaning on each other vowing never to fly with Emirates again. This time we were told to wait in an area with no seats at all for a golf cart. I noticed a folded wheelchair up against a wall so I unfolded it and put my companion in it. She was most grateful. No assistance at all from the employees whose job it was to provide assistance. Eventually a golf cart came and I got in. Then there were discussions amongst the so-called assistants, and I was told to get out and wait for a different golf cart. I was the only one in this golf cart and was dumped at the correct gate where I had to walk down the sky bridge to the plane. As I get older I will increasingly need to require wheelchair assistance when I travel alone. But the appalling way I and others were treated at Dubai Airport will certainly influence me when I choose which airline to fly in the future. I go to Africa regularly. Next time I will choose Ethiopian Airlines. If you need wheelchair assistance at Dubai Airport, do not fly with Emirates.",2,29th January 2023,Thailand

I have completed a round trip from South Africa to Thailand and Malaysia on Emirates, and have nothing but praise for their stellar product. Flight from Cape Town to Dubai was on a 777, which admittedly is beginning to show signs of age, but that did not stop the staff from giving excellent service. The other three flights were all on an A380, which was comfortable and made extremely pleasant by very friendly and helpful staff. All flights were on time, and served delicious food and drink to boot. In addition, the Business Class product offers extras such as lounge access and (in my opinion the best of all) chauffeur service, which works like clockwork.

134,"Not Verified |  We were scheduled to depart at 10.30pm I was travelling with my 10 year old son. We moved away from the gate and was told there was a technical issue so we had to return. Over an hour later we were told it was resolved and we left the gate again. As we were taxiing the pilot came on and said that Narita Airport had decided to conduct runway maintenance so we had to return to the gate again. This was the first problem - this was a lie. Narita Airport does not allow any aircraft to take off after midnight, this is why we could not take off and there is no way that Emirates did not know this. We returned to the gate and waited for an hour with no information. Then they said they would serve dinner - this is at 1am! I had no desire to eat dinner at 1am. With no further information we were told we had to deplane at 3am - so nearly five hours on the tarmac - and the ground staff would deal with us when we got off the plane. When we got off the plane, I was handed a sleeping bag with no explanation. When I asked they said we had to sleep at the gate. Eventually we were told that the flight might depart at 3pm the next day - 17 hours after the scheduled departure. No accommodation was provided or even offered. They announced breakfast at 9.30 am by which time was son was starving hungry anyway, so I had already paid for breakfast myself. Breakfast was a small piece of pizza bread and some water. There was no lunch. They did rebook my connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester, however we had already missed Christmas Eve by this point which was the whole reason we were leaving on December 23rd. Now, I understand that technical issues occur. I can even understand that we might be delayed by 17 hours. However, being forced to wait on the plane for 5 hours when they knew we were never going to depart, being lied to about the reason, not being given accommodation or proper food - these are all things I cannot accept and so wrote a complaint. My request for compensation has now been denied three times. They have said that Article 9 of their Conditions of Carriage says that they do not guarantee departure dates or times. If that is the case - how can any customer trust them to depart at a time and date that they paid for? Good food, good seats, good entertainment system, mediocre cabin crew. Absolutely appalling customer service. Every customer should think twice about using Emirates unless they are happy to be treated very unfairly when something does wrong.",2,13th January 2023,Japan

Economy class passengers are human beings too. I try to avoid wheelchairs but airports and the long walking distances with all the luggage are a challenge. They do not even start to check in economy before all business passengers are gone. They don’t even pretend to care! I don’t know if I am going to a developed country anymore.

It took 2 hours for the (extremely rude) customer service representative to offer me a flight 24 hours later and a motel (1/5 star review on Google). They insisted nothing else was available even though we were seeing tons of availability on our own. Furthermore, they told us we would get reimbursed for ubers and food during the 24 hours.

I don’t know if it’s because they don’t pay the air hostesses enough or maybe they just became over confident. I took a flight from Bali (Indonesia) to London (via Dubai). Firstly , the stewardess’s are more focused on just giving champagne than helping the customers find their seat and helping with luggage. They don’t want to do any hard work. Can’t even be bothered to smile or pretend to be kind. The business part looked more like premium economy. (You definitely don’t get what you paid for on Emirates) 10 hrs flight to Dubai and nightmare. Food has got worse and worse over the years. I don’t know if they changed the catering? Total waste of my money and time. I should have flown Qatar Airways where you get your own cabin (with sliding door for privacy) and the air hostess are super kind and friendly.

They felt like more of bouncers (i.e the men), as they didn't smile, weren't friendly or approachable, and instead of telling me ""this way, please,"" as I have always been used to during boarding, one of the men simply got in my way and gestured me to go in the other direction, without uttering a word. I found this to be a bit rude. To add to this, some crew members on various legs of my trip didn't offer me a beverage during snacktime, while they offered my neighbours some. And it's not because I had my headphones on or was asleep or seemed uninterested. They glanced at me and somehow decided I wouldn't be interested in a cuppa? This happened three different times!

140,"✅ Trip Verified |  My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on November 24th 2022 from Seattle to Dubai, seated in row 19, and sadly it was the experience I was expecting.  This was a 14+ hour flight, and one would think the crew would be friendly and check on the passengers more, however the only time we saw them was during boarding, food service and disembarking and without smiles. After and before the food service the crew were nowhere to be seen. On other flights with other airlines the air hostesses will come by a couple of time with water/ tea/coffee or just even walk by to make sure if anything was needed. I understand people may want to sleep but you can also do it without waking up the passengers. Thirdly, the food was not appetizing, and not only that but if Emirates is releasing the menu on the app with a couple options (veg and non-veg) on the plane I was told I cant have the veg because I didn’t order it, Then why was it an option and it didn’t have anything on the side that said Pre-order. Ended up taking the meal with he chicken which was dry and hard like a baseball. I didn’t eat it. We were served a pizza snack and it wasn’t warmed up well. I am not one who leaves reviews but I understand that Emirates is a well renowned brand and company and my review will not matter to them but at the end of the day it was my hard earned money that I used to pay for my Flight.

I could walk around and pick any seat I want in the lounge without having to sit next to strangers. Tables in the dining area were quickly cleared and cleaned after guests left, so they were always ready for the next guests. One unique thing about Emirates was that I could board directly from the lounge, which made things much easier. On board, the A380 was nice. Every seat had a minibar, which was nice. Emirates does not offer full turndown service the way Qatar Airways does, but a mattress pad was provided (like on Japan Airlines) to make a more comfortable bed. The gender specific amenity kit, by Bvlagri, was very nice and useful. Food was good in general, and wine selection was ahead of other airlines, but service was slow and a bit inconsistent.

The crew works very hard, but the service is just chaotic and messy with their trays, stuff stacked on top of each other. Meal service starts 2 hours after take off. On the way back used the business lounge in Dubai. It is far from the quality of lounges other airlines have, including most European airlines. Again delayed. Gipsy King music again for the 2 hours on ground during boarding. Poorly informed by the captain and mixed/contradicting info from the cabin crew. All the purser could say that “it wasn't their fault”. Overall, all facilities and procedures are quite average, food and drinks are ok. (Drinks actually very nice), crew was a mix of friendly, hard-working people and some who couldn’t care less.",9,20th December 2022,Netherlands
144,"✅ Trip Verified | This was not a very good experience. Starting with the Airport, I was forced to check one of my carry-ons due to “no space” on the plane although it was not a full flight and I was made to pay a huge amount of money just for that and what’s worse is that the bag had a lot fragile souvenirs and I risked breaking all of them. Thank goodness it was loaded in Japan and no harm was done and the bag dodged a bullet. I don’t remember Emirates being that needlessly strict. I’m not sure if the airline changed the aircraft because the extra legroom seat that I paid for was different than the one I got as the exit door was in the way so I had to lean a little on the person next to me to get the full legroom feel. It was a long flight but it went smooth and the food was extremely delicious. The flight attendant that was assigned to our row, although efficient, made me feel like an inconvenience as she had very low energy and didn’t seem very enthusiastic to the point that while was pouring me apple juice, the carton ran out of juice while the cup was half full and that’s how she served it without bothering to open another carton. For the whole flight I was waiting for her to pass by us so I can ask the other, much nicer attendant for water and/or assistance whenever I needed something. For some weird reason, the much advertised On Air WiFi did not work which took another point out. ",1,13th December 2022,Bahrain
145,"✅ Trip Verified |  I have been flying Emirates for 15 years and was a gold member for much of that time. From 2007 - 2012 their customer service was almost unmatched but things have been getting worse over the past 10 years or so and now I would say it is the worst of any airline in the world. I have flown Emirates 3 times this year out of necessity and each time it has been a complete disaster. Emirates has now switched from operating like a typical full service carrier to something more akin to a low-cost airline. Not only do they have 4 fare classes (economy, premium, business & first) but each of those classes is split into 4 types (special, saver, flex & flex-plus). The saver fares usually look too good to be true because they are! If you find a low price on a special or saver fare when booking in advance you may think you got a good deal but try to make any changes to the flight and you will soon find that the airline tries to gauge you for extortionate 'fare differences'. Even if you try to change your flight to one that costs exactly the same as the flight you are on and there are empty seats in your fare class, they will tell you that your 'fare type' is no longer available and extort you for hundreds if not thousands of dollars to make the change. Even if the flight you're on is full and the flight you want to switch to is half empty (something you think the airline would be glad of) they still try to gauge you. If you're lucky enough to get through to customer service, they will not offer you any assistance whatsoever - their job is just to extract as much extra cash from you as they can. I have come to expect this and so avoid Emirates where I can. My latest experience with Emirates customer service was far worse than my already very low expectations. I tried to use the Emirates app to make a change to the flight time. I had a Saver fair so there was a change fee of £100. This was clearly stated in the terms and conditions of the ticket so I was happy to pay. However, when I got to the screen to put in my credit card details, the app crashed. I tried again and the same thing happened. Rather than keep trying to work with a defective app, I called the airline to make the change over the phone. A recorded message said that the airline was extremely busy and that if I was not flying in the next 48 hours, I should hang up and call back later. I complied with this request and hung up the call. As soon as I got back to my hotel room, I got on the laptop to make the change. despite only being a couple of hours later, there was suddenly a 'fare difference' to pay. Since it was the Emirates app that had failed when I tried to make the change and since their call center was too busy to take my call at that time, I was sure that Emirates would do the right thing and match the price from when I had first attempted the change. I thought wrong! I spoke to a hopeless fist line call center worker who could not help so I asked to speak to a supervisor. The supervisor said that he did not have any authority to make changes to flights, despite the fact that he told me that he was the most senior person in the airline I could speak to. Eventually, I was put through to another man a second level supervisor (or ""officer"")",4,2nd December 2022,United Kingdom

I didn’t know I have to carry my baby even when he’s asleep. I asked for bassinet and they said if baby’s legs are not straight while lying in bassinet then it’s not for the baby. I had to carry him throughout the flight because he was mostly asleep. When they provided me meal I couldn’t open my table as while holding baby table couldn’t be opened. I barely ate a little and gave up. Meal for baby was also not provided although it was included in the ticket. It was a huge disappointment. I couldn’t use inflight entertainment either for baby because there was no room.,1,27th November 2022,United Arab Emirates

152,"✅ Trip Verified |  Overall business class is quite good with friendly and polite flight staff. Few cons: seats are quite narrow. I'm 5'4"", 125 pounds and my elbows were hitting either side. You can lay on your back quite comfortably but I don't know how a bigger person will be comfortable especially on long haul flights. In each of the 4 legs at every meal time, the flight attendant asked me "" do you want to eat dinner/ lunch/ brunch?"". Of course I would. Where would I go for sustenance on a 15 hour flight? It's not like I could jump out the plane for takeout or fix myself a sandwich. Felt like a weird question like I was waiting for a free meal in a soup kitchen.  Meal service was super slow. On one of the legs, the flight attendant set my table for brunch and the actual brunch arrived 45 minutes later, during lunch time. And my vegan brunch was just a Chia seed pudding which was probably dumped into a bowl from a Mason jar so not sure why the delay. The vegan options were quite pathetic and almost unpalatable on 2 of the 4 legs. Just a mush of steamed rice/ noodles and veggies isn't really a vegan meal. For a $5k ticket, I'd have hoped Emirates would've been a little creative and thoughtful with the vegan meal. ",9,6th November 2022,United States

156,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Frankfurt via Dubai. The service on board was great. The touchscreen of the board entertainment system is on some planes are better than on others. The movie collection was vast but didn't fit my taste. My seat wasn't locked. So, it changed position without pushing the button. However, those minors didn't bother me because of the good value and the great staff. What bothered me is the lack of goodwill of the Emirates on ground service. Emirates offered to reschedule the booked flights because of the Covid-19 pandemic for three years (what was great). However, our daughter became 13 years old during that time and a new more expensive adult ticket was needed for her. However, we saved about 150 Euro for her previous ticket, we had to add another 600 Euro for the new ticket. To get the new ticket kept us almost two hours on the phone with fast speaking call service assistants. On the way back, we had to pay additional 217 Euro for overweight. That was new for us, because we always could have one to two more kilogram per suitcase. Maybe it is standard nowadays, but every weight scale is different, therefore I think airlines good except two kilos more per suitcase. Families seem to be disadvantaged in this concern. They count the overweight as total. If family members check in individually, they could save a few bucks.",10,28th October 2022,Thailand

I went and repacked a few things and lined back up and the same lady went and told every other agent about me. I have never been treated so poorly by airline staff. I ended up in tears and they couldn't care less.  It isn't much better on board. The cabin crew are not overly friendly, you press the call button and it takes so long to get help you wonder if it worked. The food is also average, one of the meals was so horrible, I couldn't even eat it and they feed you at odd times. The entertainment options are terrible, most of the options I hadn't heard of to the point where I downloaded movies on Netflix to watch instead.

A particular air hostess kept telling me off because I crossed my legs and my foot slightly went onto the aisle, I mean we were so squished. I fell asleep and they didn’t serve me the first meal, or even offer a drink when I woke up, they just past me as if I didn’t exist. The second meal was an excellent portion size, the food could barely fit on the tray. I particularly liked the greek yoghurt and granola, and cheese and biscuits - for the hot food it wasn’t impressive. I had better food on cheaper airlines.

Emirates confirmed they received his payment, the money was out of his account, but part of his flight is not yet confirmed. After a couple of attempts, they made some adjustments and sorted out the issue a few hours later. My booking could not process payment due to a pricing problem between the airlines. After numerous failed attempts over 3 days via customer service and live chats, failed rebooking attempts for the same route, and empty promises from customer agents calling me back, I finally just booked another date to ensure that we can at least spend Christmas together. NEVER in my life have I experienced any issues like this with Qatar (or any other airlines for that matter). Emirates advertise routes and when it comes to booking, they're not able to process and if they do process, they do a half-ass job which leaves customers feeling stressed and running around trying to finalize flight details.

They made our flight a horrible experience and on purpose they did not offer baby food in a 7 hour flight. All crew looked unhappy and were unpleasant to talk with mostly female crews.

Young newly married couple who were clearly already pretty tipsy on boarding starting boozing hard as soon as it took off and kept a steady pace of drinking solidly for the entire 8hr flight. Cabin attendants kept giving them can after can even though they were getting very drunk. No consideration for others seated anywhere near them and it was really quite uncomfortable given the volume of their constant loud drunken chatter. After we landed at Dubai as I was standing in the aisle waiting on someone lifting something down from the overhead bins the male passenger staggered to his feet wobbled towards me and aggressively barked “where do you think you’re going eh?” Thankfully he was drunk enough I could sidestep him and leave him swaying around but come on Emirates you’re better than this.

I was shocked. How could any airline be so insensitive knowing that these customers are flying with an infant and a 2.5 year old so the least they could do instead of sending us a little text and email giving us no option whatsoever to change or contact them to discuss or be decent to call us at least to see if this was acceptable or not, did we want to change our flights or else cancel and get a refund as they have breached our contract.

There is no other way for us to contact them now at all because when we call their only one number in London you get the due to high volume of calls we can’t answer your call, when I tried the only number given in Dubai nobody answers.

I every time I call them, they say ""Ma'am, we've emailed the airport and haven't heard back yet. Please be patient."" I've called the airport, and the representative I spoke with said that Emirates needs to show up in person to locate my missing suitcase - he said that just emailing the airport, as they've done, will accomplish nothing. When I relayed this info to Emirates, they refused to listen. Everyone I've spoken with tries to get off the phone as quickly as possible without taking steps to investigate the issue. It's incredibly frustrating to be stuck in this limbo with airline that will not solve a problem that is their responsibility to solve.",2,29th August 2022,United States
181,✅ Trip Verified |  A very pleasant trip on Emirates Economy from Dallas to Dubai. EK remains the best in Economy. I couldn't fault this flight at all. Check in was easy and friendly ground handling agents despite Dallas being chaotic due to the storms. Onboard the cabin crew were friendly and attentive. The food was plentiful and the IFE was excellent. Wifi was slowish at times but suffice for WhatsApp and communication. I was dreading flying 15 hours in coach but EK made this experience a lot better! ,3,28th August 2022,United States
182,"Not Verified |  After being concerned about our Qantas BC flight to Singapore with their issues, we were really looking forward to flying Emirates BC for the 1st time. Qantas blew Emirates out of the water. Worst business class ever. Really disappointed. You pay a lot to fly business class, so the expectation that something as simple as the food to be hot should be expected. Both flights the food was Luke warm. Can't stand cold food. It maybe the size of the A380 business class, but the whole set up seemed cold. Took off, and it was like a conveyor belt. Seat cushion on for sleep. Food orders taken. Place mat down. Crew were like robots, zero warmth. Qantas do the same, but just felt totally different. More customer interaction and dare I say warmth. 777 flight was a little better but the food was still cold. Sorry unacceptable in business class or even economy for that matter. Not looking forward to our flight from Europe back to Singapore in 6 weeks. When you save to fly business class, when the airline gets it wrong you feel ripped off. Yes they got us there in one piece with our luggage so I suppose I should be happy with that. We get to try Singapore Airlines and Turkish Air BC on this trip as well. So these flights on Emirates I dare say will be our last. Quite simply they don't live up to their reputation which is such a shame.",2,25th August 2022,Australia

184,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled with many airlines until à now and it was the worse service I got. The first time I didn’t get my luggage on arrival and no compensation above all. An airlines who allows itself to plan short connection, and arrives late in Dubai, to the price of leaving your luggages behind. And after complaining to the customer service, this is what you get : “ Dear Miss Bacconnet, Thank you for your correspondence. I regret the inconvenience you experienced when your baggage was not available for collection upon you arrival in Paris on 30 May 2022. Our records indicate that your baggage was unintentionally left behind in Dubai and subsequently returned to you. Compensation for delayed baggage is offered to passengers to assist with the purchase of essential items of an immediate need. Passengers who are residents in the country where the claim has been registered are not eligible for this payment. Delayed baggage compensation also does not cover consequential expenses such as hotel accommodation, transportation, loss of income etc. We are not in a position to offer compensation and recommend that you contact your insurance company for assistance. Thank you for the opportunity to respond. We hope to have the pleasure of welcoming you on board in the near future under more favourable circumstances. Yours sincerely, Emirates Customer Affairs” Apparently, even though I don’t leave in Paris, I don’t have “essential needs” because my country can its residents all their essential needs. It is well known that when you live in a country, everything is free for you. Like I didn’t pay the hotel because I had to wait for my luggage for almost two hours after someone came to me to let me know it’s not gonna come today so that I missed my train back home. Consequently I had to book a night in a hostel because a hotel in Paris is crazy expansive. And as I didn’t have essentials I had to pay not less than 4€ to rent a ridiculous cheap quality towel. The service onboard is not exceptional, the crew is not really willing to help. The AC is crazy low and when you ask for second blanket, it looks like you ask too much. Compared to Qatar there is no free wifi allowance. ",4,23rd August 2022,France
185,"Not Verified |  Since it was sudden sandstorm on Sunday 14August 2022,our flight was delayed from Bahrain and then Dubai too. Wen we arrived Dubai Airport then Emirates staff gave us Boarding passes and meal vouchers for another rebooking which was 6 hours later and I asked for lounge or some waiting areas from the staff since I carrying 1 month infant with me along 1 child, she denied saying that lounges are all occupied because all flights are delayed. I again understand that lounge may not be available but she could have shown some empathy and could have tried from her end to facilitate us by saying let me check if possible. I was not informed that there will be no announcements on this airport and she did not even tell that your gate may be in another building for which you will have to go by bus or metro which takes another 30-40 minutes at least. Somehow I found a place to feed my baby which was quite far but concourse B was mentioned on my Boarding pass so I thought its near only we went to relax n feed my baby and later our gate was changed to another building and I did not know it will take such long time to reach there. Running through the way we couldn't manage it to the gate, we missed that flight too. I believe Emirates staff should communicate with the passenger clearly about the important information specially when someone like me who is going on Dubai Airport first time. I could get direct flight from Bahrain to Delhi but I wanted my family to experience the service Of Emirates and they experienced the worst experience, partially because of bad weather Delays and partially because of staff's miscommunication or no interest to facilitate the passenger with special need or request.

The supervisor and the assistant had completely forgotten all the etiquette and the hospitality they are supposed to extend. I feel Emirates must give refresher courses to the staff and continuous evaluation should be taken to maintain the standard. When I expressed my displeasure they were asking me what should I serve to make me happy and I told them we don't choose Emirates for food. I'm thoroughly disappointed with their attitude and behavior.,9,3rd August 2022,United Arab Emirates
191,✅ Trip Verified |  I am a Gold member of Skywards. During a flight departing from Toronto to Dubai the flight crew allowed the children sitting behind me to use my seat as a climbing frame. With no regard for myself or the other passengers within the row nothing was addressed. Eating the served meal was impossible as was any attempt at drinking any fluids. This was drawn to the attention of both the parents and the flight staff all to no avail. If the children were not climbing then they were kicking the back of my seat. The children would seldom sit even during turbulence and during take-off and landing. After so many years of traveling with Emirates this whole encounter will cause me to look at alternate airlines.,2,1st August 2022,Oman
192,"Not Verified |  I have flown Emirates extensively in the Lisbon-Dubai route and I find their product rather consistent. This last time check-in took a bit too much than I would expect for Business, but security fast-track works well and is convenient. In Lisbon Emirates uses the TAP lounge which is a bummer as other than being very crowded at all times, it is located before passport control (Schengen area) which forces people to leave much earlier than boarding start. If flying Business in the Boeing 777-300 do choose the front mini-cabin (first 2 rows before the door) as all the 300+ Economy passengers board through the door before the aft cabin leading to an annoying 1h boarding process with people passing by. Food and crew are usually great and very helpful and friendly. At Dubai very easy process to go through priority passport control and to reach the complimentary limo service, all very efficient. I have found some drivers to be quite rude and/or driving dangerously - Emirates should improve their standards for this personnel. All in all, Emirates is one of the few airlines offering a truly distinctive premium service, from the moment you leave home until you set your feet at your destination hotel. I will continue flying with them.",5,1st August 2022,Portugal

However, when I arrived at Amsterdam my flight had departed. I was offered a flight 24 hours later but turned it down as I would miss my brother’s funeral and I would be devastated. I was offered and accepted an alternative flight via Entebbe, Uganda, which I accepted. However, when I arrived at Entebbe I was refused boarding on the flight to Nairobi - Emirates had messed up. I had no money for an alternative flight and no roaming on my phone so I Whattsapp’d my husband in UK and he phoned up Emirates Dubai office at great expense and after half an hour convinced the call handler to book me onto a later flight to Nairobi. I missed my brother’s funeral and I will never forgive Emirates for their incompetence and lack of care.

194,"✅ Trip Verified | Service is below sub standard. I travelled with my 2 daughters of 2 and 7 years. I bought my seat at the time of booking and the system wouldn’t let me to do the same for my daughters. At the time of online check in, I found out that my daughters were seated 7 rows ahead of me on their own which shocked me. Furthermore, I raised my concerns to the officer at the check-in desk. Her seat allocation was more terrible than the system. She allocated me in the middle seat, 2 year at the aisle and 7 year aisle right across making her to sit with a stranger. I was frightened to hear that bad news and had to escalate the issue to the supervisor. Finally, after 20-25 minutes of waiting, supervisor made me (compulsion) to sit with my daughters 7 seats ahead of my paid chosen seat. At least, it was a big relief for me before boarding. Money paid for my chosen seat was gone into Emirates account and no refund was made until now. More paper work following to claim it and a waste of time, so let Emirates enjoy that undeserved money. Service offered by the airline was below standard when compared to the rest of Middle Eastern Carriers and other standard carriers. Families travelling with kids were of least to no concern by the crew. However, I have to admit that Emirates managed to arrive the destination on time. On the return leg, my luggage is not delivered yet or lost on the way. Another issue to deal with Emirates now. Service had gone from standard to pathetic. I need to think million one times to make another booking with Emirates. Families travelling with kids are not recommended to choose this airline.

195,"✅ Trip Verified |  Checked in at Bergen for flight Oslo with SAS connecting to Dubai with Emirates. Arrived early. Waited at gate in Oslo before flight started to board and was 2nd in line. Bags were checked all the way through to Dubai, where we would then have a rest and get a flight to Melbourne the following day. Attempted to board and told our tickets had been cancelled - by us! Somehow in the air from Bergen, we decided to cancel our own tickets and delay seeing our 4 children and give up a weekend in Dubai - seems unlikely. Argued the point but no interest in listening to us and the flight left without us. We were not told where to go, who to contact, how to get any help and we had to wait for hours for our luggage to be returned to us after it was taken off the plane. We spent two days stranded in Oslo airport with no help from Emirates at all. Our travel agent confirmed that it was in fact Emirates that cancelled our tickets - for being a “no show” which is 100% wrong and we can prove this. We spent money on hotel, footed and lost money in Dubai from prebooked accommodation. Emirates would not give us anything in compensation. Flight home was empty / half full. No offer of upgrade or anything at all from customer service (or lack of customer service!). After a terrible flight home, straight through to Melbourne we were now a day late due to the airline. We lost a days work and had to re-schedule deliveries at additional cost to our business. After several attempts to write, email and call emirates customer service on return to Melbourne, we have had zero response! The lack of service and care for customers is disgraceful. I was prepandemic a frequent international flyer and in 20 years I have never seen such a poor display. I will never fly this airline again. Emirates is an appalling company that cares nothing for the customer experience. They do not care for Australian passengers - it’s all about looking after their own profits. Fly at your own risk as they will cost you money and care less.

They also has absolutely no priority for kids not in boarding and not for caring a small kid has special need like diapers you can not just easily book them in next day flight at midnight. With all these problems they put on us, they also did not want to let us take our yoyo stroller on board, we had to fight them and without stroller at midnight in a closed airport when they book us on next day flight I do not know what we should do.

203,"✅ Trip Verified |  In the last 4-years, Emirates customer service has become one of the worst. I doubt they are any better than a 2-star service. Their airport staffs are either rude or cold. Their in-flight food service is mediocre. Although, the food is above average. They offer minimal service when it comes to offering water or drinks during the flight. I tried upgrading using family account points, a feature with Emirates. It is more or less a scam scheme designed to pool all your points in your family account. The idea is you can upgrade your journey or family members' journey using the family account. However, you cannot access these points when you want to upgrade. So you are left with no points in your account and storing all your points in your family account, and you can't use them. Emirates airport staffs and cabin crews are so poorly trained. Both Airline check-in staff, Cabin Crew and support staff have no clue how the family account works. I heard 4-different versions of the policies. They send me round in circles on 2 different trips, and the issue still remains unresolved after a week. As a gold member, I get a pleasant smile and a warm welcome, but that is just faking a few words that have no value whatsoever. Anytime I requested any help, I more or less got nothing for being Gold. The only thing that remains for being Gold is Fast Check-in in the Dubai airport and a few other airports outside the UAE, Lounge access, and sometimes faster delivery of your check-in baggage.

This is their reply: Dear Mr Boutrid, Thank you for your correspondence of 31 May 2022 regarding Emirates flight EK 758 from Algiers to Dubai on 28 April. I am concerned to learn of your disappointment with the lounge at Algiers airport. This lounge is operated by a service provider. Regrettably, not all lounge operators have the selection of food and beverages or ambience that we offer in our Emirates Lounges. However, your feedback is noted and has been shared with the relevant team for their information. Through emirates.com we do advise customers that for technical reasons we are unable to provide Wi-Fi, mobile phone, mobile data and live television services on every flight, or guarantee a continuous service. Emirates' liability is therefore limited. However, I acknowledge that this added to your disappointment. With regard to your request for the mixed grill, we always aim to match the quantity of choices with the predicted passenger preferences. While we do our utmost to meet all passenger requests, sometimes there may be shortages of a particular meal choice due to previous passenger selection. Shortages of a particular meal are continuously monitored in order to adjust ratios accordingly for future flights. It is my understanding that got your first choice of starter (potato soup), your preferred dessert, the chocolate caramel tarte, and opted for the beef meal instead. On another note, Business Class kit bags are offered on flights over 3 hours 30 minutes that depart between the hours of 22:00 to 05:00 and on all flights over 9 hours regardless of the departure time. However, certain toiletry items are available in the lavatories for the comfort of our passengers and may also be requested from our cabin crew.

After 10 minutes when nobody turned up my husband reminded the same lady at the counter that we need help to which she replied I am on some other report and we should proceed towards manual counter. We were shocked! My husband reminded her that our baggage is stuck to which she responded with irritation and called some technical staff to provide our baggage. Then we proceeded towards manual counter where again with technical glitches our check in was done in half an hour when all our documents were properly in place. In short more than an hour to check in at Dubai airport with Emirates without rush whereas in India within an hour we were done with check in, security and immigration!

I always felt like an economy class pax on the ground both at check-in and in the lounge both in Italy & USA. Far different from what you feel flying QR in business for instance. Return flight on A6-EEA was disappointing because the aircraft was showing his age: my suite was completely worn out, sliding doors broken. EK should pay attention to this details and make sure everything is renewed especially in premium cabins where there is too much difference between aircraft to aircraft for A380's in their fleet. The food was very good quality in both legs. JFK-MXP flight was below average because of the service that was either too slow for the main meal or too rushed during breakfast. Shower SPA: both ways good experience the bathroom is huge with plenty of amenities and this is the real plus rather than the shower itself. Overall I think business class is the only product that worth the premium price for EK.",1,6th June 2022,Italy
216,"✅ Trip Verified |  Emirates services are getting worse day by day, I had my flight from Dubai to New York where i had my connecting flight for Nassau, which they changed the time and destination to Newark. The bag drop counter was closed, so I had to take all my luggage to the counter of JetBlue to checkin. When I reached Jet blue the attendants were not helpful at all said the counter is closed and my flight departure times has been changed from 7am to 10am. And they are unable to take my luggage and won't provide any accommodations that I should take my complaints to emirates counter. Emirates ground staff refused to help said I should contact customer service. As I did not have a USA number I had to use my roaming services to call Emirates customer service, after 45 mins being on call i was told that they cannot help and I need to contact ground staff of Emirates. When I went back to Emirates ground staff they said they can't do anything as it was their closing time. Not to mention my flight from Ewr to Nassau also kept getting delayed. I was stranded at the airport as I was not able to arrange a hotel because by the time I could finish all this run around and phone calls it was almost midnight. The only option to eat was dunkin donuts. Worst part was both Jetblue which was affiliated with Emirates and staff of Emirates did not showed any regrets. They cared less if I was being helped or directed. I bought my ticket from the website of Emirates and this was my worst experience ever. I will always avoid flying with this airline.",4,4th June 2022,Bahamas

At Cochin on my way back on Sun, 29th May, they wouldn’t allow my carryon citing allowance limit. Didn’t have a second bag and had to carry my laptop and electronics in a duty free bag to LAX. Happy to comply with rules, but they can’t and shouldn’t be discriminatory. LAX and COK can’t have different rules for the same tickets and airlines. Many passengers in economy from COK were in violation of the number of carryons and weight limit as stated on the tickets.

Great service from the cabin crew, who were attentive, but also had a great sense of humour and seemed to be genuinely enjoying the flight. A light breakfast was served after departure from Dubai, with fresh fruits and breads. Lunch served about 2 hours before arrival into LHR. My wife and I chose the Fish tahta as a main course. This was roasted Kingfish in spicy rice, really tasty and generous portion. The Emirates Bar is a great feature on the A380 and we enjoyed a cocktail and a laugh and joke with the cabin crew.

Emirates use the Air Mauritius Les Salons Amedee Maingard lounge, which is ok but not the standard of a typical Emirates Lounge. Flight boarded and departed on time. As this is an overnight flight Emirates serve a dinner service soon after take-off. I had the Chicken Biryani, which was OK. Unfortunately for my wife, who was being served from the other aisle, their system failed and they forgot to serve my wife’s main course.

Even though the flight was at 02-35 the Business Class lounge at the A gates was quite busy with limited seating. The bonus was boarding direct from the lounge. My seat was 14E was quite comfortable and the cabin crew offered supplementary mattresses. Passed on the initial meal service on this overnight flight.

Service was good in the lounge and after about 15 minutes they served a hot lunch. The Goan Chicken Curry was pleasant. Flight boarded and departed on time. My wife and I had seats 14E and 14F which are ideal for a couple travelling together. At the time of travel masks were mandatory, Emirates provided spare masks and sanitizer. The food service on Emirates used to be quite drawn out but with the new system they take the meal selection from the passengers on a hand held device and it seems to be delivered in quite an efficient manner. I chose the Arabic Mezze, which was very tasty followed by the Beef Tenderloin, which was also good. Good choice of wine available. Emirates only serve one meal on the flight from Gatwick to Dubai, which we found to be sufficient. Snacks and sandwiches are available at any time, either delivered to your seat or from the bar. Overall a very good flight with Emirates.",6,25th May 2022,United Kingdom

After pressing 2 buttons I was talking to a rep after less than 2 minutes. Much to my surprise, for a base ticket, he said I was entitled to a refund and sent me a refund form. Nothing arrived for a month so I again phoned and the mistake I had made in completing the refund form was explained and another sent. After only 2 weeks a partial refund for 'no show' was credited to my account and when I queried why 'no show' for a cancellation I received an apologetic mail confirming full refund which duly arrived after only 10 days. This compares with Ryanair who will fight tooth and nail to avoid any, even legitimate, refund. Guess where my loyalties will lie in future - Emirates!",1,25th May 2022,Portugal

Things that impressed me included the superb food and wine on all sectors (incl a nice printed menu and wine list), the wonderful Emirates First Class Lounges in Dubai (especially their prime lounge), the speedy and efficient boarding and the good cabin crews. Not so good was trying to get to a toilet in the middle of the night and having to make my way past lots of drunken passengers filling the bar area at the back of the A380 - which is also the area where the toilets are. I suggest this Lounge area could be made a barista coffee lounge instead (as much as I like a glass of wine). All flights pretty much on time.

228,"✅ Trip Verified |  Only the second time I choose to fly Emirates, so I will not make a fast decision as to use this airline again or not. But I have to say that in all the years I have been flying business, the CDG - DXB sector was a complete disgrace. From the chaotic boarding in Paris when all first and business class passengers were held at the gate for 25 minutes (apparently for no reasons except that some sort of VIP showed up at some point and cut the line), without so much as an announcement from the person in charge. Once everyone was on board, the first announcement from the captain was about an hour delay in getting a takeoff slot. As we pushed back, their APU went out, no lights and aircon and back to the gate. Then some very vague information from the flight deck on some repairs being done, and another slot waiting time. Anyway the whole deal lasted 3 hours. Ok, that is a technical problem, it happens and that is the way it is. What bothered me during the whole time was the complete disdain of the cabin crew for the passengers. As a matter of facts, most of them seemed to enjoy the delay and were having some very long and loud conversations with some apparent friends in the aisles. The flight finally took off. And this is when the cabin crew showed its complete inability to handle the most basic service. Absolutely no care for the passengers, and except for some meal served in a hurry (during which I actually had to beg for a glass of wine previously ordered ) we only got to see them once in a while during the whole 7,5 hours. I want to think that this was a bad timing, or else. On the other end, the second leg of the flight from DXB to Moscow was excellent, and I actually found out how much was missing on the first leg then: Friendly and helpful cabin crew, good service. After all this is what we ask for in a flight! My rating will be below at 5/10. Zero for first leg, 10 for second leg.",9,22nd May 2022,France

When I arrived at the Emirate ticketing counter in order to obtain my boarding pass, I experienced a bad situation which I have never had with any other airlines. The ticketing lady had a very bad attitude told me to show her my Covid test result which I did, then asking for Vaccination card that I responded that I am USA citizen and there is no need to have this card, which she started talking loud and being so rude, finally I found my card and passed it to her. After that I was glad that the issue was resolved and now she would process my luggage. I was wrong. She laid back at her chair and doing nothing. Finally I said to her this checking takes long time, please process my luggage. At the end I went to her team leader and explained her behavior. I am sure that the leader would not do anything to correct his group attitudes, because all of them are the same and they do not know any better, but I am sure that Emirates will lose more customers as times pass.

KHI-DXB, check in was friendly, flight was on time, clean plane, food was outstanding for a flight not even 2 hours long, crew was very friendly and attentive. Blankets and extra pillow were given. Landed in Dubai, went to the Dubai connect desk as it says on their website that if you have more than 10 hours layover, Emirates will provide you accommodation, at the desk, the guy was rude and straight up said Karachi office should have booked you earlier (Karachi office is the one that told me to contact Emirates at Dubai as they have no authority to book anything with Dubai Connect) and I was also told that even a prior booking was made, it would have been cancelled because accommodation is only available for passengers who bought tickets worth more than $1000 USD. Then I went back to the connection desk, explained the whole situation all over again, guy at the desk started blaming me that I am the one who chose to have a longer layover so it's not Emirates problem, he kept ignoring that key information that ""Emirates is the one who cancelled the flight from KHI to DXB, not me"". I have to admit, I became a Karen when he told me Emirates can't offer you anything, no compensation no food, nothing for a 15 hours layover. I refused to listen to him any further and demanded to see a manager right away, he ran back and got the manager at the desk, manager was extremely polite and apologetic, instructed to hand me over 2 meal vouchers immediately (previously I was told Emirates do not have any meal voucher offers etc, so that was the lie). So guys, if you want to be treated fairly by Emirates, you gotta fight hard. DXB to CDG, flight was on-time, full. Crew was very attentive, plane was spotless, food was disgusting. They served feta cheese sandwiches, they were absolutely inedible and were freezing cold as well that it hurts you teeth. Then the lights were switch off so it was good sleep with enough legroom. Breakfast was served an hour before landing and main hot breakfast was inedible as well, fruit portion was fresh but the bread roll was so cold that I couldn't slice or bite it (should learn from Turkish, they serve soft warm rolls). I have also noticed many people didn't eat the hot portion of the breakfast. I have to give a shout-out to one particular crew member, she handled the situation very well when she was yelled at by a grumpy middle age man when she asked him, if he would like to have a breakfast, he started yelling at her that ""no, I'm sleeping, can you see, stop yelling into my ears"".

Who wants to be the unlucky fellow to sit in the middle of the 3, paying premium price? The service is OK but not great either. Food was as bland as ever, the seat is really narrow and uncomfortable. OK for a short to medium haul flight up to about 6 hours, anything longer than that would be an ordeal.

I have booked this trip in Jan, already paid for a domestic flight from Paris to Lyon that departs from Paris at noon on a same day I land there. Called Emirates, explained them the whole situation, even sent them a receipt of 100 euro plane (non-refundable) ticket I have already bought from Paris to Lyon, all they said, sorry, but that's not our problem if you gonna miss your connecting flight to Lyon. I kept on insisting that I must take the original schedule flight from DXB to CDG as planned so they must fix it. After a long argument, I am good to fly but with 15 hours layover at Dubai. I asked them for an accommodation through Dubai connect program, they refused to book anything or even provide a meal voucher (like Qatar Airways) reasoning that I am the one choosing to not to fly to Paris on immediate available connection, therefore, no accommodation or food for you. Their telephone rep people are so rude (not the Karachi one, Dubai helpline), literally telling me they don't care if I'm going to miss my connecting flight and that's not Emirates headache.

235,"Not Verified |  Friends, do yourself a favor and do not book with Emirates. They are extremely unreliable and will cancel your flight at last minute. We flew from Chicago to Dubai to Amman and they ended up canceling our flight from Dubai to Amman. They rescheduled us for the next flight with a 18 hour layover with a 2 year old. We ended up needing to push our flight one day which made us lose precious time with our family that we haven’t seen in 3 years. Then our flight home from Amman to Dubai to Chicago, ended up being canceled again and now we are trying to change it because I have my sisters wedding the next day. I may be forced to miss it because of emirates irresponsibility to keep flights as they are when you book. Also, the food is horrendous and give no vegetarian options, I had to survive off the snacks I bought before hand and what the flight attendants gave me.

It was my first Emirates experience in 3 years, and as far as I was concerned nothing had changed, apart from the boarding procedure in Dubai which was nothing short of shambolic - but that is the airport, not the airline. As a direct result of the ineptitude of the gate staff we pushed back 1 hour 20 mins late. No matter. The service was friendly and efficient - nothing was too much trouble - and the food and drink really good. One doesn’t often have memorable meals on board any aircraft (preparation of same must be trying in the extreme), but the lunch served was top notch. A bonus in business class on board an A380 is the on board bar area, once again, service was excellent.

An announcement was made by a pilot stating the delay was due to 'baggage handling technical problems.' The digital menu was not working. I asked a cabin crew what was on the menu, and they stated to ask another crew member. Toilets were not clean and were smelly. I requested a drink in the galley from a cabin crew and he pointed to cups and a bottle of water and said 'get it yourself.' Cabin temperature was freezing cold. The seat was comfortable.

The previous high quality service, little touches that made you feel a valued customer and friendly attendants onboard are all gone, vanished. Instead they've replaced this with grumpy attendants who don't pay attention to the customer, little things like noticing a low drink and filling it up before you have to ask, welcoming returning loyal customers - these are the things you pay for with Emirates and in Business class, now it might as well be a long Ryanair flight.

Food for special orders is served 15 to 30 minutes before beverage cart comes by so only water on tray available to consumer. I paid extra for better seats but given the service and noise environment, it probably was a waste. Cabin is drafty, video headsets do not fit anyone, noise during my flights (esp. to SEA) was excessive. Airline does not address selected and/or comfortable seating for passengers with infants. Four infants on my flight were training talk show hosts as their lungs and screams lasted the entire 15 hour flight to SEA. The plane was full and staff gave little concern for passengers. On arrival in SEA the airline took forever (1.5 hours) to get luggage to customer even though I had a first class luggage tag on my one bag. Onward booking by airline had incorrect boarding info for ongoing flight and barely made the connection. Cannot imagine what others waited and how many missed connections. Yes, SEA is an airport to avoid for customs and general connection flights. But airline is responsible for getting luggage unloaded and Emirates failed customers but staff luggage was first off and first picked up. I will never fly Emirates ever.

My luggage never came through after 40 mins. I informed an Emirates employee and they claimed that my luggage was already loaded onto my next flight. Upon going through customs, I missed my flight, so I was stuck in Dubai. I was forced to wait in 3 different long lines for a total of 5 hrs, just to be told that because I was a no show, I had to pay a $1200 fee. I informed the Emirates representative of what happened and they became rude and walked away. After 5 hrs I was able to speak to someone who understood situation and got me a next morning flight for my destination of Male. Upon receiving my new flight I was stranded in the airport for 17hrs before my 2:30am flight. On my original flight I paid for a extra legroom seat, but on the rescheduled flight I was forced to sit in a standard seat that really hurt my legs. After taking the grueling flight to Male, my luggage never came. I reported the incident to Male airport staff and they started an investigation for my luggage. I finally was able to take a transfer to maldives, but without any clothes or luggage. This entire situation ruined my vacation because this was over the weekend.

Their incompetence gave me a hard time travelling with my baby who was very tired after a long flight and since we trusted Emirates notifications, we got to the airport desk to find out our visas were not organised and had to wait 2 hours in the airport for this. I could have easily paid for my visa weeks in advance and had a hassle free experience but even with repeated enquiries with Emirates customer service, I was told the visa was complimentary and not to worry about it. Truly horrifying experience and they never managed to compensate their messing up with anything. I had to pay for my airport hotel stay as we were not willing to wait two hours for just visa processing and then going out of the airport for their complimentary stay.

The agent asked me to go ahead and claim a refund for the unused sector which i did but was denied, i have sent her multiple mails and she does not respond to emails or calls. Emirates customer affairs are extremely unprofessional. Emirates is not a good airline and their service is sub-par at best. ",2,25th February 2022,United Arab Emirates

Food is very mediocre (chicken tikka masala with rice on both legs of my journey inbound and outbound!) and planes are tired. The food service comes on a night flight after 3 hours when people are asleep. Today I have been waiting for over 2.5 hours for luggage in Heathrow london.

252,"✅ Trip Verified | EK020, 26/01, Evening flight, easy good check-in but soon became aware afternoon flight had been cancelled so they were amalgamating flights. A380 gate at MAN is always hard work but this was totally chaotic with ground staff failing to get a grip. We queued for 20 mins to board but found we were in the wrong queue, the one to get reallocated from the cancelled flight. This was because staff failed to tell anyone what was going on. 90 mins late we took off, full flight. It was ok but the number of babes in arms crying meant no sleep, food was the usual but due to being full it was slow. On arrival we were all herded without announcement for an additional no option PCR test which was also chaotic, although it was free. Return flight EK19 on 10/02 was better serviced, on time and food was better but yet again the crying babes meant no sleep whatsoever. Bottom line is the A380 gate at MAN is still not fit for purpose and because of the popularity of those with very young children we won't be rushing back.",1,11th February 2022,United Kingdom

At the beginning everything was ok but when the plane took off they put AC on and it got extremely cold. As we and many other people on this plane were flying from hot country to hot country nobody was thinking to put on any warm clothes, the only one thing that was helping everyone were the blankets. I did inform the flight attendant twice but they didn’t do anything with that. Maybe there are some areas on the plane where it is not that cold but they didn’t offer us any help though we had a baby and baby was cold. We fly a lot and such situation has never ever happened to us. Crazy freezing flight. The company doesn’t care about the costumers. Service was not good as well.

256,Not Verified |  I booked a return flight from Zurich to Johannesburg. Emirates advertised on their website that tickets are flexible (due to COVID) and can be changed or cancelled at anytime without any additional cost. My return flight got cancelled due to COVID and I requested a refund so I can book a flight home with another airline. Not only did they refund only about 20% of the price I paid but they also didn't refund my miles I used for this flight. In my opinion this is very misleading advertising. It is also the third time within a year where Emirates has disappointed and not lived up to their promises.,10,25th January 2022,Iceland
257,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had the most horrific experience with Emirates travelling from Spain to Sydney. Our flight was delayed by an hour from Barcelona. We let the crew know multiple times that we had a connection to catch. They told us not to worry, there'll be ground crew waiting for us once we land and will make sure we don't miss our connection. But #Emirates had already cancelled our next flight after an hr into our seven 7 hr flight, this was 6 hrs before landing. Once we landed there was no crew waiting so we ran to catch the connection until mid-way the #Emirates personnel appeared telling us about the cancellation. They're rude and ignorant to the fact that we were sleep deprived, tired and could not grasp why no effort was made to make up for the 1 hour delay or contact the ground crew. Also both my partner & I had picked up a cold virus (not Covid, got the negative PCR) and felt horrible. We were both feverish, barely managing to speak and the crew treated us poorly. First they gave us seats far away from each other twice. I couldn't understand how they could make the same mistake twice. Second they told us we can't get the exit row seat, we'd paid extra for. They told me, it wasn't their responsibility to refund the money and I should request if from Emirates.  I just requested that we wouldn't be seated near any small babies and they said fine. They kept telling us to collect our luggage, but with the condition my partner and I were in and the fact that my feet had already started swelling up, it was impossible. So we said no. Since no one was helping and it was 3 am, we thought to go and check in to our hotel & sleep. We were already at our limits but thought we make the best of it, go visit the Dubai Expo and all. But things just started getting worst. We were in nightmarish state until we got home. We had to walk for an hour to get to the shuttle that would take us to the hotel. The Emirates crew at the Airport entrance couldn't help us with Expo tickets, cause they didn't care. We had been given one meal voucher per person for 24 hours. And the hotel had no amenities. After multiple arguments, the meal problem was fixed, which wasn't that useful cause the quality of the food was so bad that all the passengers in the hotel were ordering deliveries. We'd to go and buy clothes, toothbrush, deodorant, etc for ourselves which was a waste of money. The hotel couldn't even be rated at 2 stars and there was always at least one person arguing and shouting with the staff and complaining. We survived the whole ordeal and got to the plane to find couple of things that we were assured were fine, were actually not. We ended being seated beside a baby that cried for 10 hours of our flight without exaggeration, there were empty seats at the end of the plane, they just didn't bother to check for us. I did ask for a change of seat at the gate and in flight and every time I was told there were no empty seats. We arrived at Syd airport in a chaotic situation to collect our luggage. They'd given the wrong belt, so everyone spent an hour at luggage collection. ",2,24th January 2022,Australia

The airport staff were rude and they did not do much to help. They gave us vouchers for dinner, but the restaurant that we went (Gallery) gave us the lowest quality of food with that voucher.

263,"✅ Trip Verified |  This was a poor experience from start to finish.  Arrived at the airport to find there was a four-hour delay to the flight. Emirates, however, did not check in bags so no one could go through security or otherwise move to an area with seats available (there were about 30 seats in the area for 200+ passengers). There was very little communication about what problem, if any, caused the delay. Ultimately, Emirates did begin check-in and then began a shuffle of repeated delays until, about seven hours later, Emirates cancelled the flight. Very little communication. ""Maybe there will be a flight tomorrow."" Called Emirates and no answer. Tried online chat without success. Ultimately turned to twitter to get rebooked (had onward flight). This in turn led to the agent trying to charge me an additional several thousand dollars because of fare differential between flying days. I pushed back hard on that, but got the sense Emirates simply sought to profit. Agent tried to put me on a flight in which I would miss my connection to a city served only once every five days by air. Emirates, unlike other airlines, won't book passengers on cancelled flights onto other airlines. Ultimately, Emirates added an additional flight the following day. Told us to get to airport four hours before, but then wouldn't check-in rebooked flight until two hours before so the two flights wouldn't get confused (why then have us in area with no seats and tell us to just stand there for several hours?). Onboard, seats were cramped. My child got a ""kids meal"" she didn't ask for which consisted of one burnt chicken nugget! Service was lackluster. I've flown more than two million miles on other airlines; Emirates was down near the bottom. Seems they are seeking to coast on their reputation but are no longer willing to do the bare minimum.",1,2nd January 2022,United States

I as well as almost all of the passengers had to wait for over one hour staring at the carousel for our luggage to come out. We landed on time and going through customs was very fast. Arrival was at about 9 pm, I was done with customs by 9:20 pm, BUT I had to wait at carousel 1 from 9:20 pm until 10:45 to get my luggage. Although Emirates may say that they're not responsible for what happens outside the airline, the passenger is charged a fee for going through Newark Airport, and therefore the airline is also responsible. One other issue which may seem unimportant, but it actually is very important: The entertainment is extremely difficult to use as I when I played a movie a radio station presenter came on with advertisements. Despite trying several times, I could not get it to go to movie sound mode. Ground service I place a one star as I said earlier, Emirates is also responsible for the huge delay of not only my, but almost all of the passenger's luggage.",5,1st January 2022,United States

270,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a trip from London to Muscat and then Muscat to Dubai for a week before returning to the UK. Emirates left us stranded in Muscat Airport. They had cancelled the flight and not even notified us of this cancellation. They had just put us on another flight 40 hours later without telling us. We turned up to the airport and the flight did not exist. There was no help desk at the airport, their App was down and we couldn't get through to customer service in Oman or the UAE. We tried calling customer service in the UK, and were still not put through to anyone 40 minutes later. Bearing in mind, we were having to use our UK mobiles abroad. We had another British couple come up to us who hear our conversation and were going through exactly the same thing. I am over six months pregnant and this was meant to be a honeymoon for us because our original wedding and honeymoon were cancelled due to COVID. In the end we had to rent a car to drive over the border as there weren't any flights to the UAE for 12 hours and we did not want to spend the night in the airport when I was six months pregnant. We tried to complain in Dubai & we were told they couldn't do anything, we had to report it via the website upon completion of our full trip when we arrived back in the UK. I lodged a complaint & we have just received the below response, which takes no accountability and tries to pass the buck to FlyDubai. Firstly, they are part of the same group and secondly, we booked our tickets through Emirates & they took full payment for the whole itinerary. Therefore, we are their customer & we are nothing to do with FlyDubai. They offered us a measly 10,000 miles each, which costs them nothing & is completely worthless since their restructure of airmiles a few years ago. You need a min. 50-100K to upgrade. Emirates response: Thank for your correspondence and naturally, I regret to learn that you were affected by a schedule change and that you only found out when you arrived at the airport. I do appreciate the inconvenience you were caused, especially as I understand that you are pregnant. If I may explain that you booked a ticket which included two different airlines. Although there is a partnership, Emirates and FlyDubai are two separate companies and Emirates have no control over the operation of their flights and vice versa. In this instance, the schedule change occurred to your flight from Muscat operated by FlyDubai; whilst I am not aware why their proposed flight EK2033 on 5 November was removed from their schedules in advance of travel, I would like to explain that unfortunately, there are rare occasions when these cannot be avoided due to operational or commercial requirements, or other unforeseen circumstances. That being said, I note that you experienced difficulties when you tried to contact us and I would like to take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of Emirates, as well as our partner FlyDubai. Whilst we are unable to offer any reimbursement of expenses incurred as a consequence of a cancellation of a flight operated by another airline, I would suggest you contact your private travel insurers, as standard travel insurance policies usually cover such situations. Nevertheless, as a gesture on our part to apologise for the negative impression you have been left with on this occasion, I have credited 10,000 goodwill miles to both your Skywards accounts. Miss May, I do hope that you will continue to choose Emirates in the future.",2,1st December 2021,United Kingdom

(All Indian Regional Movies were there and even though Japanese) 3) Flight started after an hour late, and no announcement was made, and you failed to meet timeline, attached photo as a ready reference 4) No sound system was provided, and repeated requests were made to provide one but ignored 5) In-flight attendants were not responded to, while they were called several times by the passenger (I tried three times but no response) 6) Food options were not there and only asked to take what was available like either vegetarian or chicken 7) Disembarkation took very long, almost an hour, and no announcement made to inform passengers 8) The cleanliness of the cabin was not satisfactory at all 9) COVID-19 supplies were inadequate and discriminatory (No kit provided other than a hand sanitizer tube).",2,1st December 2021,Canada

He helped with finding space in the overhead bins for cabin bags, was very friendly and motivated, and provided excellent service. During the entire flight he paid attention on passengers wearing their face mask, and made remarks to the ones not wearing it. In the past (before Covid19), I experienced some flights where service was lacking and unsatisfied, but this was a pleasant experience. Only negative point is the self check-in at Dubai Airport. People are guided to self check-in machines, also elderly and less frequent flyers, big families, and it takes very long time to have their check-in completed. Especially when they have excess baggage and already half of the bags have been send through. After completing check in, still have to queue up for passport and PCR verification at another Emirates desk, which makes the self check-in less convenient.

276,"✅ Trip Verified |  My wife and I reunited in Seychelles in August 2021 after being separated by the pandemic. We had planned to return to the Philippines where she is a citizen. Upon checking in for our first flight with Emirates, the supervisor said I needed a visa since I was a USA citizen. We attempted to explain that Philippines allows a visa on arrival for foreign spouses traveling with their Filipino spouse under the Balikbayan program. We showed our original apostilled marriage certificate as proof. However, the supervisor stated their system did not list these other provisions. We attempted to show multiple IATF resolutions that the Balikbayan had been allowed for several months, but she stated their system was updated daily. We agreed to follow up during normal business hours since this was Friday night. When I asked for documentation regarding my offloading, the supervisor indicated she couldn't provide this and that I'd have to make an online complaint. We were able to confirm by phone and email from the Bureau of Immigration that I should be allowed entry with my wife. We then showed this documentation to different Emirates supervisors at the airport who expressed confusion as to why I was prohibited to board in the first place. They agreed to independently confirm with Emirates airport staff in Philippines and the airport immigration officials. After they did, the airport supervisors confirmed we could rebook our flights and I would be able to board. We incurred thousands of dollars of extra travel expenses while obtaining this confirmation. And our connecting airlines refused to refund us our tickets without documentation as to why I was prohibited to board. When I requested this documentation from the online complaint system, I did not receive a clear response about the matter for 10 days. And that response added that the Balikbayan program didn't apply to me since I wasn't a Filipino even though I had already provided them emails from the Philippines BOI and the Emirates airport staff confirming I should be allowed to travel. I spent the next month continuing to email, resubmit documentation, and call anyone at Emirates who'd listen without any success. I did not receive any corrected documentation about the offloading, any financial compensation or flight credits, not even an apology acknowledging their initial mistake! Each time they continued to cordially reiterate that they took ""the matter seriously"" and ""have nothing further to add."" International travelers, especially Filipinos, should beware flying Emirates! They're playing the role of immigration without the knowledge or authority to do so. The online complaint system for Emirates is a travesty of a mockery! You can only upload 2 documents at a time. And you can't make multiple submissions without waiting for Emirates to reply. A week or two later. There's no one you can talk to about matters like this by phone either! I asked to speak with supervisors and managers multiple times without any success. Each time they referred me to the (useless) online complaint system. I don't even know why they bothered to send me delayed replies.

But, what was controllable, was the level of customer service. No customer should be told that they cannot rebook with another airline after an airline has breached they ticket contract or else they would not receive a hotel voucher. I believe this is the era of choice? The customer doesn’t put themselves in the unfortunate position of an airline being in breach of their airline ticket. And should a customer then choose another airline to reach their destination, the airline should know that the customer did not choose to have to rebook a flight. Nevertheless, the flight a customer chooses should be entirely up to them, given the option. Emirates should never try to hold people hostage after they mess up!  Customers should never be ridiculed for not choosing an airline they no longer trust.

On this flight one of the lavatories flooded and remained so on the entire route. The wine selection was decent but the food was utterly inedible and honestly hideous to look at. All I could eat was the soup and it was heavily salted. I've had much better food in economy class of poorly rated airlines. Last and least, the entertainment system was difficult to operate.

I had to go in person to ticketing agent to solve the problem with return tickets dates to be able to come back to work in time after vocation.  The ticketing agent said, that to be able to return on that date I will have to stay in Dubai 25 hours while on initial reservation it was 17 hours. I asked about a complimentary hotel and she tried but failed to book it in the system , and offered to do it later. On my way back to the USA in Dubai Emirates desk refused to give us free hotel and we had to spend 25 hours sitting in the airport. ",8,3rd September 2021,United States
287,"✅ Trip Verified |  The worst airline that I've ever used on every aspect. On my inbound trip from DFW to Beirut, they cancel my trip from Dubai to Beirut and booked me on a different trip with very long connection time. The refused to give me a hotel even though, they changed my flight. They keep many seats open and they don't allow anyone to use them but on the other hand, passengers are packed in some section of the plane. It is great way to spread COVID 19!. I will never use this airline again.",1,23rd August 2021,United States
288,"Not Verified |  Was travelling to Nairobi after undergoing treatment, at Indira Gandhi International Airport we get to the check-in and the people there are so rude. They shout at you to do this and do that. The customer service from Emirates in that Airport is terrible to say the least. Anyway we get there and the guy checking us in tells us our booking is unavailable, that we need to leave the line - no explanation no nothing! We came to learn later that UAE had a new fly rule regarding long layovers for passengers from India. Now I don't know if they knew that but an apology would have been considerate regardless. We did pay over $1500 dollars for that ticket after all. Mind you we even had the e-ticket from Emirates with the confirmation and everything. Honestly I get much better customer service riding an Uber at 1/hundredth of the cost. Super disappointed. ",1,16th August 2021,Kenya
289,"✅ Trip Verified |  A big scam! For a family of five with a little child with us, spending nine hours at the airport was really a very bad experience. I booked my flight in April and I chose a three-hour connection for the august 13 trip from Tunisia to Bahrain. The eve of the flight, I found out that the flight has changed and the connection had been extended from three to nine hours. I spend more than one hour running with my kids and suitcases from one connection desk to another trying to get a lounge to spend the night but in vain. No one at the airport knew what they were doing. I finally went to the only hotel in the airport and to my surprise, we had to pay more than 3000UAE dirhams to stay overnight! Did I ask for my trip to be suddenly changed? Did I ask for my connection to be extended? Did the company notify me and provide me with a hotel room to spend the night with my kids? Who did you fly in the 2 am flight that we initially booked and paid for?",1,14th August 2021,Bahrain
290,"Not Verified |  We booked as a family our annual leave to our home country on 1st July, and they provided A380 where it was fully booked the boarding process took them long time leaving passengers in the middle of nowhere even families with small kids like our family we were suffering without any help from anyone of the airline. During airport procedures I was injured with a small finger cut so once we are in the air after switching off seat belts sign I pinched the attendant button, and for 40 min no one came, to the limit I went to attendants place to request band aid. I have a boy and a girl where one got served with kids food and the other not for 30 min till I stood up again and requested for the food, and the answer I was provided that “sorry the oven is broke”. I had to take the same airline traveling back to Dubai for some work and I hoped to have a different experience, once I approached the check in counter I was informed that the flight is delayed with 105 min, and the flight took off  Delayed more with 150 min.  I wrote to customer service to compensate such loss who took them 2 days to reply my complain explaining how they are aiming for best customer service and trying to be number 1 and by the end they told me nothing and no compensation.

293,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cabin crew were amazing, the flight from ORD to Dubai was great, the airplane was spotless, food was average, or below average but the economy seats and entertainment were above average. The flight from Dubai to Cairo was almost at equal standing, bathrooms were dirty most of the time though, the main problem that will prohibit me from recommending this airline to anyone is the experiences that I had with their ground crews in Chicago and in Dubai. Counter check-in and package drop off process overall with Emirates were the least efficient out there between the other lines that were checking in at the same time, needless to say that I spent almost 45-60 mins to finalize this step while the whole infamous TSA passport control process took less than 15 mins from start to finish on that busy day. When I finally made it to the check-in counter and I presented my Emirates compliant (not country-specific, Emirates ask for more than that) PCR test, they questioned whether or not I meet the time requirement simply because they compared the sample collection date and time in (CST) with the final destination departure time which was in Dubai local time without accounting for the time difference, after explaining that she took the test and disappeared for 10 mins before returning with the stamp of approval. Right after that she printed our 3 boarding passes for the trip to Dubai and beyond and asked to place our two carry-ons and two backpacks containing our personal items (our laptops, tablets, snacks, medicine, toys, and a change of cloth for our 4-year-old toddler) she stated that they will all be treated as carry-ons and that we were only allowed to bring two of them on board, and that if we don’t we will need to pay $200.00 in extra fees, or we can take our backpacks and check-in our carry-ons, she explained that this carry-ons restriction were a company policy imposed due to Covid, what does Covid has to do with the carry-ons and personal items allowance policy? I never had this experience ever with any other airline including my previous flights thru Emirates & Etihad, no one ever considered my laptop carrying bag as a carryon it was always listed as a personal item which I was allowed to bring on board to stow underneath my seat, I was in a state of shock and I told her that those carry-ons contained items with rechargeable batteries but that didn’t seem to sway her mind, I was in no position to argue at that point and took as much as I could from those rechargeable items form those carry-ons stuffing it into our backpacks just to follow my own safety protocols, on flight I saw many passengers boarding the airplane with their carry-ons and backpacks, and I highly doubt that they paid the $200 they wanted us to pay at the counter! Finally, the point where I completely snapped asking to see the supervisor on-site is when she-alongside another colleague of hers stated that my toddler' aviation approved child seat was not allowed inside the cabin and then they tried to charge me for an extra fourth seat claiming that to bring this on-board I’ll have to pay for an extra seat! I was like my child is 4 years old, we paid for his seat ticket of which we will place this child's seat! nothing changed their mind until the supervisor came, and I told her that we have three tickets for all 3 passengers, and she agreed with our point of view. Filed a complaint with their customer service to get a generic response.",1,8th August 2021,United States

295,"✅ Trip Verified | First of all, on the return flight, the staff delayed opening the gate, then I found my confirmed seat was busy with another passenger, so they were changing my seat without talking to another passenger. Second, I asked for water 3-4 times, then they provided me with a cup of water, not a bottle of water. (It's strange to have this in corona time). Third: the food was not tasty at all, it was very cold. Fourth, they announce that the internet is free to use, but in reality, it needs the passenger to pay money to have it. (And hosts not supported any passenger to get free internet). Fifth, they start collecting the headset 20 minutes before the flight ending so you couldn't keep watching the movie. Sixth, There was a shortage of covers and they were not available on the plane.",4,27th July 2021,United Arab Emirates
296,"Not Verified |  Their customer service is absolutely atrocious. Their website is not updated and they do not take responsibility for lacking to keep the passengers up to date with Covid travel requirements. I booked my flight two months in advance and checked the Emirates website daily in preparation for it. I am fully vaccinated but still needed a negative covid result, no problem, I got it done. When I got to the airport they said the covid result needs to be stamped. Turns out, all labs in the USA are FDA regulated and do not stamp their results for authorization. The only place that does so is inside the airport, by appointment and costs $175. I learned all of this as I was checking in for my flight. So there is obviously no time to make it and I had to miss my flight. Normally, airlines take responsibility for this and accommodate the passenger by rebooking them free of charge. Not Emirates, their reservations/customer service first said that the next flight is 11 days out, and then gave me no choice but to pay another $2000 to book a seat. I've never experienced anything like this with any airline. They are usually accommodating and not money hungry.",5,11th July 2021,United States
297,"✅ Trip Verified |  I am writing this review for my dad who flew Economy from Toronto to Dubai last Saturday. He booked Emirates hoping that they provide what they promise during this pandemic (safe flights, hygienic, booking half the flight's capacity, etc) but my dad had a horrible experience. The flight was fully booked which was quite bothersome at a time when everyone around the world are practising social distancing, the faucets in both the lavatories in his proximity were overflowing and I was told that the crew had been wearing the same masks throughout the 13-14 hour flight. This is an epitome of how Emirates treats its non-premium class as the ""cattle-class"" and that basic hygiene and comfort don't really matter for those who decide to fly at a lower rate. Really ashamed at Emirates for the inequality that they show. During these unprecedented times, they must take into account the passenger's health and safety rather than looking at profits. Please provide what you promise, Emirates. Your advertisements with the cabins being sanitized and having fully vaccinated crew (who knows?) really are just for attraction, aren't they? Do what you preach to begin with.",10,5th July 2021,Canada

Our carry on bag was scaled for weight and allowed in to fly from SFO. We landed in Dubai and checked in again to start boarding. We were stopped to measure the carry on bag weight. The staff in Dubai was extreme rude , ill-mannered and disrespectful to deny the fact that the same carry on bag was allowed from origination point. Dubai staff did not allow the carry on bag with same weight. We were forced to take out almonds bag of 2 lbs and trash it which were carrying for my parents in Dubai.

But I actually needed 3 documents so I wasn’t allowed in Dubai .. they only asked for two documents at SFO to board the flight. They gave me a refund due to they inconvenience but took it back when I tried to fly back from Dubai to SFO for some odd reason. They said I was supposed to call and rebook the flight to go from Dubai to SfFO which I did and now they’re saying they can’t find that phone call  and they tell me just submit a complaint form.

However having the ticket in hand, as a frequent flyer, I am told that there is no availability to upgrade with points; only a payable upgrade is offered.

307,"Not Verified |  Flight turbulence, both ways, was terrible. The food was horribly over seasoned, the highlight being the champagne. All of that was still quite manageable. The flight back was the real fail. We picked this aircraft specifically for safety and spacing during COVID. They switched the flight the night before and left us in a bulkhead middle seat, surrounded by coughing strangers. They had an entirely empty first class section available, which they wouldn’t let us pay for or upgrade to for the flight. While speaking with customer service they were equally unhelpful. There is no service left on this airline, especially in a time where rebuilding travel and customer safety/comfort is so important. Avoid Emirates- the hype is not delivered upon!",10,24th March 2021,United States
308,✅ Trip Verified | Emirates switched our airplane with absolutely no notice to any passengers. Entire business class cabin is furious as moved from 2-2-2 new seats airplane to old 2-3-2 configuration where families and couples have been split up and all kinds of Covid infractions are happening. Crew says this 'happens all the time and people are always mad'. Probably a dodgy cost save that puts people at risk. Far from the ritzy commercials you see this is a second rate business class experience at best. Try and book elsewhere.,10,24th March 2021,United States
309,"✅ Trip Verified | This is not a premium airline anymore. The days of Emirates being a premium airline are long gone. By now their planes are old, seats and Inflight entertainment systems are broken. On the way up to Dubai 2 out of three seats has sound only in 1 ear. And one seat could not stay in position. The touch screen did not work. On the way back 1 seat and 1 sound system did not work out of three. They charge heavily for wifi and they charge significantly for a seat in front. At a rate where other airlines offer premium economy, Emirates just let you sit a couple of seats in front. European and US carriers by now have closed the gap and surpassed Emirates offering better wifi, premium economy and more innovative entertainment systems (Delta lets you watch from your own iPad). KLM flies this route with brand new 787's. But where an airline should make the real difference, Emirates fails even harder. Service. They get stuck in organizational bureaucracy. Emirates call centre gave you the wrong information? Your problem. That issue cost 200 euros? Your problem. The manager says no. Can I speak to that manager? No. Self-service check-in doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in another line of self-service machines. Still doesn't work? Your problem. Go stand in the back of the line at the classic check-in counter (after spending 30 mins waiting for machines that don't work)? Can't check you in before you do a covid fast test. Go to a very badly signed fast test area. Everybody there is already checked in? Being around the self check-in Machines gives you a true to life Ryanair experience, but Ryanair actually does a better job. People with issues all over. And this is covid times, with a lot less traffic. I wonder what happens when it becomes busier.",2,23rd March 2021,Netherlands

I paid for business class special, on the day of my departure as I was checking in my luggage, I was told my passport has a hold on for an unpaid fine, I needed to go see immigration. Having 1hr 25min left, immigration advised me it was a police hold, I was to leave the airport and go to the police station near palm Jamaeria, this meant I was missing my flight, that I just updated by paying 4K cnd on top of my original ticket extra. I arrive to the police station I was not told what the issue was for but that it was resolved i still do not know why My passport was on hold. I called the Emirates to book my new flight business flight that I paid extra for, this all happen on a Wednesday they had a flight leaving everyday to Toronto direct, but the only way I could get my business seat was if I updated it to a business flex, they would not honor this seat I paid for already, saying there is none available, They booked me in an economy class as I’m sitting on the plane right now with Extra business seats available I sit in economy. This airline is a rip off, they have the worst customer service, and all they care about is how to squeeze your money out of there customer, I recommend if you plan to take business class, don’t cancel that flight because your new flight will not be business, you will half to upgrade the seat you already paid for or go first class, be prepared to pay more money.

We filed a report at the airport before leaving and we were told that someone will get back to us and that we should check the bag status with a reference number. We contacted them over 20 times through phone calls/emails requesting at least a deadline to know that our luggage is officially lost so we can re-purchase the lost items. On every occasion they promised that someone would get back to us directly, of course no one ever did! Thinking emails might work but we only got vague replies stating that its still under tracing and asked us to fill a form with the value of all items in our bag and someone will get back to us with either our luggage or to compensate us, but that never happened. 49 DAYS LATER, we finally decided to file an official complaint on their website to which they responded that our bag arrived Dubai airport.

It was reported to the supervisor and head of stewardess, it was not a good experience. Deplaning was disorderly, I have experienced how carriers do disembarking by rows and requesting passengers not to get up until their row is called, in this flight everyone was just pushing to get out, like there was no pandemic.

All meals are covered by plastic lids which is a slight annoyance as there is no where to put these or they fall on the surrounding areas. But we can live with this. Drinks service was constant. I visited the onboard lounge/bar which is elegant. My only continued gripe about EK business product is that their main course meals are lacklustre, look like economy meals on a china plate and do not do the rest of the product justice.

I opted for the refund and within two days the full amount had been credited back to my credit card. Over the past few months, I have had to cancel a number of flights and have battled with airlines to get refunds. It is often been difficult even to speak to the airlines and on one occasion I have obtained a refund through my credit card company.

The biggest shock of my life was the lady at the ticketing office on 8th July around 2 pm -5 pm she shouldn't be working as a customer service personnel at all, she is badly mannered, she does not display any form of empathy all, I explained my situation to this lady and what she said was ""all flights for July has been cancelled and it's not only you"". My point is if you cancelled my flight and I already told them my situation why cant they just inform me that theren is a repatriation flight they just displayed a nonchalant attitude, meanwhile i have been following up with their flight for more than a month and several repatriation flight left and still non of them informed their customers about this, they are only happy to cancel your flight taking advantage of the situation without even informing of the next and available options for their customers.

Whilst Emirates guaranteed ticket flexibility to people who were travelling during this period (they let you change the travel time) I was disgusted by the fact that if you change your return flight Emirates will charge you for a one way ticket which is double the price of a return ticket. So instead of you only paying for the difference between your new ticket and the old ticket you also have to pay for the difference between a single trip and round trip which is absolutely ridiculous and I don't think it's at all acceptable. The Emirates website was saying that all tickets are sold out for they flight I've chosen and on other flight I would have had to pay even more so I bought a ticket from Qantas (which turned out to be on an Emirates flight) I've submitted a cancellation request on my original Emirates flight on 20th March and still hasn't received any response. I could't be more disappointed with Emirates, especially that I never got my unused ticket refunded. Due to this bad experience I wouldn't use Emirates again and would talk anyone out of using them.",1,4th July 2020,United Kingdom
325,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Lahore via Dubai. I am really disappointed with my return flight with Emirates. After flight resumption due to Covid, I reconfirmed my booking 5 times, on different days and they cancelled my flight 3 hours before departure. Moreover, they lied about reason for cancellation. They canceled my flight and told me CAA at Lahore isn’t allowing to land flights which was false. All other airlines we’re flying on that route and I also confirmed from CAA. Because of this, I had to have extra travel arrangements and stay at the city of departure as I came from another state.",1,2nd July 2020,Pakistan
326,"Not Verified |  Extremely disappointing. Corona crisis started. They basically cut all phone numbers, closed offices and let us without information in Thailand. They were still selling tickets for the next few days when they cancelled our flight back and did not allow us to take place on those just to sell more expensive tickets. Definitely a rip off. Emirates. Don't fly. It seems like a better pick up line for your commercials.",10,10th May 2020,Belgium
327,"Not Verified |  We had a business class flight from Auckland to Vienna booked for April 20. Obviously Corona crisis happened and we all know the story how almost all flights including this one was cancelled. The terms of the ticket clearly stated that they will refund full amount if they cancel the flight. As other reviewers had mentioned as well, they have since changed their terms so that all refunds are subject to cancellation terms regardless of if they cancel or the client cancels. Thus they are refusing to refund and try to offer their vouchers instead. Being a business class flight for 4 persons it's a fairly substantial amount. Let's consider the facts for a moment. Changing contract terms one-sided after the contract has been made, is clearly illegal and is not enforceable. Second, being an EU citizen, registered in an EU country and having paid with a credit card registered in the EU, the EU regulation clearly stated that airlines must provide a refund if they cancel a flight regardless of what they terms would have said. I'm currently processing a charge-back on the credit card. =",5,2nd May 2020,Germany

I’m then informed I cannot have a refund of my money, only a voucher. When I refuse this ridiculous offer I’m told they will then charge me $1000 in a cancellation fee if I try to get a refund. This is for flights they cancelled, and failure to provide a service they sold. Not something in my control, and not by any action of mine. In their lengthy Contract of Carriage it clearly states I am entitled to a full refund if they fail to fly. Apparently Emirates believes they can introduce new terms and conditions and that our previous agreed to contract no longer suits them. Had my bank try and reverse charges. After waiting 25 days was informed that their merchant bank sent an offer for a voucher, good for 24 months, and that if I then still wanted a refund I could get one then.",1,2nd May 2020,Australia

We contacted the Emirates customer information at Perth Airport for further information. It was confirmed that our flight was cancelled and we were told that as we were no longer a customer with Emirates how we got home was not a concern of Emirates. The phone was then hung up. We got home eventually with Qatar Airways where we had to pay twice the normal cost for regular seats. Since getting home we have been offered vouchers which we have refused saying we want a refund of the cost of the return flight. We have been told that any refund (if offered) may take many months and it is unlikely that Emirates will agree to a full refund for the return flight which they cancelled.

It is far from being so, it doesn’t even qualify to be within the first 50, unfortunately. The customer service officials are so ill informed that they can hardly be of help to the customers. They have only canned answers. The travel segment referenced to in this review was understandably canceled because of the covid pandemic. So then I called up to cancel the ticket the customer service diverted me to another website and made me fill out the entire form and submit cancellation. He said it is going to take two weeks for the refund, which was fair. Emirates is misusing the disaster to its advantage and abusing the customers. Now they say it is going to take 90 days to refund the amount. Now there is no way I can get back without being refunded the amount. Their responses are very poor. An airline quality and service is better judged at the time of an exception. Emirates has failed to live up to it’s Customer expectation.

I sent the refund form and request to be refunded and waited for almost 3 weeks but no response or refund came through. When I contacted Emirates on 6th April the sales representative said I will be charged if I request for refund. How silly and illogical is this?

Refused to book me a seat on another airline when there was many available. They couldn't care less about their customers or their (supposed) duty of care to them. A flight voucher is really useful when you've grounded all your planes and the world is under quarantine for an unknown length of time and I have to get home swiftly before borders are closed.

341,"Not Verified |  My wife and I recently flew Emirates EK345 Brisbane to Prague via Dubai 23.03 2020. It was the the most horrific flight. From the time we left Brisbane until Dubai the washrooms were disgusting No hand tissue, no hand soap, the floor was littered with hand tissue and wet from urine and or water. The floor was sticky to walk on. As were were seated adjacent not far from the washrooms it was easy to observe the cabin crew very rarely checked the washrooms. There was an over use of the seat belt signs to ensure customers were seated rather than annoying the crew serving meals I was given the choice between beef and chicken and when I chose beef was informed there was none left but if I wanted to wait 20 minutes perhaps there maybe some left over. Sure enough 20 minutes later a beef meal arrived and was promptly dumped on the meal tray and was stone cold. The crew through the 15 hours were noticeably aggressive to all and sundry. The toilets were locked 20 minutes from landing in Dubai and my wife had to beg to use the washroom. Whilst we were informed this was the last flight out of Australia I guess the crew were coming to grips with loosing their jobs. Sorry but they still should have been professional until they finished their shifts. I have since written to Emirates feedback but no response. We hold return tickets to Australia and can only hope for a better experience. Having wished for a long time to fly with this airline on the recommendation of others, what a complete disappointment I have flown the major airlines over the ast 40 years and ""never"" had anything to equal this most over rated airline.",1,2nd April 2020,Czech Republic

When travelling by Emirates it is advisable to ensure that your luggage is secure and that you do not use back packs, duffel bags or any other type of bag whereby a zip can be seperated to allow baggage handlers access to your luggage. Emirates apply a 7 day policy for making claims for stolen items, and are not prepared to consider any reasonable evidence if you are not able to make a claim within those 7 days. When raising a complaint with Emirates, customer service is appalling and respond via email with a 'no reply' email address. Business class was very comfortable and the 'add ons' including lounge and chauffeur service made the journey a lot more comfortable. Not sure if it was really worth the money though.

352,"✅ Trip Verified | Amsterdam to Cebu via Dubai. It was my first experience flying with Emirates and without the slightest doubt will be my last. I believe that critical situations bring out the true nature of people as well as companies and it is my opinion that Emirates came out as uncaring, irresponsible and thoroughly unethical. I had a return flight from the Netherlands to the Philippines and I was supposed to fly back from Cebu to Amsterdam at the end of March, but I became stranded due to the suddenly imposed lockdown. The situation became quickly truly dreary with flights getting cancelled by the hour and airports getting closed with almost no notice. The military being deployed in Manila and checkpoints set up to allow only tourists with a ticket for a flight leaving in the next 12 hours to enter. Tourists were informed to leave the country on 20th March at the latest. My domestic flight to Cebu was cancelled on 17th March and I desperately tried to contact Emirates to make the appropriate changes but to no avail: on their website, there was only a local telephone number to which nobody ever answered. I asked friends to contact the Emirates Dutch local office on my behalf, but they ended up with the same result, nobody answered the phone or Facebook messages. On 17th March a rescue flight was organized by a local private company, I landed in Clark International and went straight to the local Emirates office. The representative simply told me that they could not do anything for me because flights were fully booked, informed me that Clark airport would also be closed in 48 hours and told me that I had to figure out a solution myself. I had to purchase an incredibly expensive new flight with another airline departing that very same evening from Manila and rush against time to make it to the airport on time (I made it just thanks to the kindness of strangers who offered me a ride in a private transfer van). In the span of the following few hours i met at least a dozen travelers who had flights with KLM and who told me that KLM (not an airline partner) had rebooked all of them on Emirates flights. To summarize, Emirates made it impossible for stranded travelers to contact the airline, declined and shirked away from all responsibilities to find a solution, offered me no assistance and no compensation whatsoever, had no qualms to give away a large number of their seats to other (non-partner) airlines, but did not offer its own customers the same courtesy.

My ticket showed gate A3, but on checking the board, it showed B3 and this is where the main problem was. On arrival at the gate there was a long line waiting at the gate. I found out that First and Business class were to board by gate B2. There was nothing on the sign at the gate to state this. The handling agents seemed to be unsure of what there were doing. Then economy, business class and first class passengers were herded onto the same bus to be taken to the aircraft.

I've been on hold for the part 31 minutes, waiting to speak to the representative, and this isn't the first time I've waited this long. Most accommodation and travel websites are allowing full refunds (like Airbnb, bless them), whereas I was kindly informed by Emirates that they would still charge me SG$400 for cancellation despite the extenuating circumstance that neither is my fault nor something anyone could have seen coming (As of 16th March, Australia's government implemented a 2-week isolation period for all international passengers, making it financially infeasible to make the trip).

They were extremely attentive throughout all of my flights. I thought the food was of a decent standard - they could have offered an extended drink service but if you wanted a second or a third drink you only had to ask. Some of the flights had a velcro cover for the bassinet which I did not like as my son could easily open it but the London to Dubai leg had a zip which made me feel at ease that he was safe. The flight attendants were happy to look after my son when I needed to go to the toilet and on a couple of flights, some of the attendants went the extra mile and carried my son around the plane to give me a break. They had bottled baby milk and organic baby food which was a first for me when flying with my children. On the way to New Zealand I flew to Lon-Dubai-Bali-Auckland and I preferred this to the return leg when I flew direct from Auckland to Dubai which was nearly 17 hours and I would not recommend it with a toddler. I thought the inflight entertainment was of a high standard but I could not connect to the Wifi on any of the flights.

During the flight, the Emirates staff gathered at the rear pantry and were talking loud for a long time. Could not sleep with this irritating loud chatting. The toilets were not once cleaned during the 6.5-hour flight. Several toilets had a malfunction with water and some toilets had urine on the floor. Terrible! The seats were not very wide, narrow in fact, and had a hard seat. It was a claustrophobic experience. The seats have had their best years long ago.

On my route from Manchester to Brisbane I had 3 flights all with separate crews and the service I received on the first two flights was awful.

Obviously you still pay Emirates price. On top of this they are totally careless about frequent flyer, so If you fly for business choose other airlines.",2,2nd March 2020,United Arab Emirates
367,✅ Trip Verified |  London to Kolkata via Dubai. Rude staff that treat your special meal as a nuisance. I had to ask the stewardess for mine and it arrived 55 minutes after everyone else had finished their meals. Take the blankets and headphones 30 minutes before landing to save time and costs. Dubai to Kolkata is a farce at the gate. No organisation or concept of common sense.,4,27th February 2020,United Kingdom
368,"✅ Trip Verified | London Stansted to Colombo via Dubai. First flight with Emirates after several years using other airlines and I must say standards have slipped. Emirates used to be a cut above, with better food, IFE and more generous alcohol supply. Now they are very run of the mill and when you add in the inconveniences of Dubai airport compared with other options in the gulf they are solidly average. I used them because Stansted is my local airport, so their flights are convenient and because of this will probably reluctantly use the company in future. Low point of my 4 economy flights was the unsmiling, unfriendly and arguably rude crew member I had looking after my part of the cabin on the outward leg from STN. Not once in 7 hrs did I see her make eye contact or smile at anyone, including her colleagues. The other crew I encountered were generally friendly and reasonably efficient. The seats felt worn and were not as comortable as I remember, probably as the aircraft are generally ageing across their fleet. The food ranged from edible to fairly horrible, only the IFE remains outstanding. Drinks were grudgingly supplied after a couple of hours in the air and were of indifferent quality, although top ups were available if you went to the galley.",7,27th February 2020,United Kingdom
369,✅ Trip Verified |  Orlando to Dubai. Excellent cabin crew who were very welcoming on board this flight. Staff looked after us really well in Business class. I really couldn't fault them. Individuals like themselves are a credit to Emirates. IFE has a wide selection of movies and the dining was of high quality. My only criticism would be if the Orlando route was not served with the updated Business class seat that is currently available on the other US routes; the current dated lie-flat seat is only adequate for short to medium haul routes but not long flights to the US.,4,24th February 2020,United States
370,✅ Trip Verified |  Chennai to San Francisco via Dubai. Over priced. Not good enough and comfortable seat for long journey. What I'm most disappointed is the service they offered during on board. Worst food and service. When you ask for extra glass of water the response is we will serve once we are free.. And that is after 30 minutes (after multiple reminders).  When I ask for nuts/snacks response was please go help yourself. Never ever try Emirates again. Moreover my luggage was damaged.. Send them mail after mail. No response from them after a month or so.,1,23rd February 2020,United States
371,"Not Verified |  I've flown business class (as well as premium economy) many times on long-haul flights between Asia and the US, on a pretty wide variety of airlines. For my current trip, there appeared to be a reasonably good business class fare (but not the best fare among all airline selections) to NYC via Dubai on Emirates, apparently because of a long (7+ hour) layover in Dubai. Even though it wasn't the best business class fare available among all airlines, and the layover was longer than I'd prefer, I chose Emirates based on their reputation. However, Emirates doesn't inform you when purchasing the ticket, and you don't find out until you arrive at the airport in Dubai, that this business class fare does not include any lounge access. So, you basically get a slight discount on a business class fare, but no business class lounge access during a 7+ hour layover. Also, on the Emirates 777-300ER, the business class seat does not actually lay flat (its angled quite a bit), and the leg / foot section of the seat when extended is rather flimsy. Unless you have a child-size body, it's quite difficult to get comfortable for any actual sleep on a long haul ""business class"" flight with the type of seat that Emirates installed on the 777-300ER. Based on my actual flight and in-airport experiences, I'd rank business class on other airlines much higher than Emirates business class. For long haul travel between Asia and the US, I'd even rank Philippine Airlines business class in a higher category than Emirates, particular because Philippine Airlines business class fares are typically several to many hundreds of USD cheaper than Emirates best business class fares, and you aren't subjected to any undisclosed trickery relating to business class lounge access. I'll avoid Emirates in the future, for sure - Emirates is way overpriced for what you actually get. Come to think of it, for a route between Asia and NYC through the Mideast, I'd have to say premium economy on Qatar Airlines is a much better value for the money, with a reasonably good comfort level as well as excellent service, as compared to Emirates business class.",7,16th February 2020,Singapore
372,"Not Verified |  Manchester to Denpasar Bali via Dubai. A faultless flight. Chauffeur pickup on time, good lounge at MAN, both flights on time, professional and helpful cabin crew, excellent food - red snapper on MAN/DXB leg was restaurant quality. I found the seats very comfortable on both aircraft. I appreciate that some do not like the slight incline of Emirates' lie-flat seats on the 777 but it's never bothered me and I had 6 hours' sleep on the leg to DPS. For me, this is exactly what flying should be.",5,12th February 2020,United Kingdom
373,"✅ Trip Verified | Male to Dubai. We boarded our flight and proceeded to wait on the tarmac for 3.5-hours! The flight was then canceled but because we started calling customer service while on the tarmac we were 2 of 300+ people that were able to get on the next flight which then waited on the tarmac for 1 more hour making us miss our connecting flight which then made us miss our next connection. The worst part was when we got to Dubai we had a 5 hour layover until our next rebooked flight. Emirates wouldn't get us a hotel because it was less than 8 hours and they wouldn't let us in their lounge because we weren't business class. We sat at the airport 2 hrs for our flight, we sat on the tarmac for 3.5 hours, then we sat on the tarmac for 1 hour, then we sat on the flight for 4 hours and got to the airport and were told there was no compensation, no accommodations, no customer service. We needed to sit at the airport for 5 hours until we could sit on our 14-hour flight. We spoke w, 3 different representatives, at different counters as well as customer service on the phone and Emirates refused to take any responsibility for 2 extremely late flights and the nightmare we were going through. I heard Emirates was nice and took care of their customers but that is definitely not true.",10,11th February 2020,United States
374,"✅ Trip Verified |  Shanghai to Gatwick via Dubai. I bought an Emirates student fare one-way ticket as they promoted in China, so the value for money is relatively good. I initially just wanted to use it as an opportunity to experience A380 (my first impression of Emirates at that time) as well as avoiding more expensive one-way fare of British Airways, but it turned out that the flying experience was really more stable than  other planes I had experienced, and the touchdown on the runway was also the best experience in my lifetime. The seat was a little bit too narrow for me, so I gave only four stars. The meal was really delicious and fitted well to my taste.",3,8th February 2020,United Kingdom
375,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Zurich via Dubai. After hearing nothing but great things about Emirates I have been left so disappointed. Our first leg from Brisbane to Dubai started with them not giving my 7 year old daughter her meal. Not only did they forget the first meal of the 14hr flight but I had to ask them again for the second meal. Approximately 4 hours out from Dubai the oxygen masks dropped from the panels above. After 15 long minutes we were advised that they thought it is a technical issue. Passengers were then asked to fold up the oxygen masks as best we could and they were left hanging in front of us. Following this there was no in-flight entertainment or service for the remainder of the flight. No compensation was offered and staff seemed more concerned about passengers who were recording the incident. After our horrendous flight and poor service from Brisbane, I asked at Heathrow about an upgrade and was told flights to Brisbane were fully booked. This was not true as the Dubai to Brisbane leg was half empty and many people had three seats to themselves. The check in procedure at Heathrow we had to use the self service machines and this was not made clear until we had already queued for 25 minutes. There were no toilets in the lounges at Heathrow and Dubai which meant that once you had shown your passport and ticket and gone into the lounge you had to go back outside to the toilets and then queue again. Our flight from London departed at 9pm. My daughter didn’t end up getting her meal until 11.50pm. It took them 2.5hrs to commence the meal service. The flight from Dubai to Brisbane was no better. My 7 year old needed to go to the toilet as soon as we got on the plane and the toilet hadn’t been cleaned. My 7 year old fell asleep on take off so I asked if her meal could be kept for later when she woke up. I was told this was not a problem however when I asked for it 7 hours later I was told we she couldn’t have as they couldn’t reheat it. I then had to ask if I could at least get the other food that didn’t require being reheated. The customer service on three of the four flights was absolutely appalling. The flight attendants were not pleasant and friendly.  On one flight I pressed the buzzer for some water due to my daughter being asleep on me and no-one attended at all – the plane landed 1.5 hours after I pressed the buzzer and we disembarked. I could not get over the amount of time the seat belt signs came on when there was barely any turbulence. On top of this, the excessive amount of time they kept the seatbelt sign on when there was no turbulence was ridiculous. At one point it had been on for over one hour and my daughter needed the toilet. We got up to go to the toilet and I was told I would be going at our own risk.  It felt to me that they kept the seat belt sign on for an extended period so the crew got out of doing work. I have travelled extensively for the past 20 years and Emirates is the worst airline I have ever flown with. Do not waste your money. I will never fly with them again.",3,8th February 2020,Australia
376,"✅ Trip Verified |  My last trip was in January from Bengaluru to Rome and back, via Dubai. The flight from Bengaluru to Dubai on 29th January, good service, food and punctuality. However, the best service that I ever got on Emirates till now, was on the Dubai to Rome flight, EK 97 on the same day. The flight departed on time, cabin was clean and the cabin crew was very much on their toes to serve the passengers. I would like to particularly appreciate the service by the cabin crew Anthala . I know it is very difficult for the cabin crew to be smiling and go about their job with long hours of flying and adjusting to time differences. I would like to thank and appreciate the service provided by her on this flight.

377,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Cape Town via Dubai. All 4 flights departed on time. On board service good. Food inedible. Ordered vegan meals which were terrible. Dinner ex Bangkok was rice with peas, carrots and mushroom.  Totally unimaginative meals. Surprised to get an amenity bag on the Dubai to Cape Town sector.  Hot towel also handed out on same sector which is something i haven't seen for a long time. Overall a good experience except Emirates must look at the special meal quality which is very poor.

378,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kolkata to New York JFK via Dubai. I am totally disappointed with their service. During check in when I asked to provide a seat near to my family members (traveling on the same route, but different PNR), the check in agent did not replied anything, but issue the boarding pass with the seat which was randomly assigned 48 hrs prior to the departure. However, the DXB-JFK flight was almost empty, so I can sit with my other family members. Food quality as well as quantity was tremendously poor. They served one meal just after taking off from DXB and another meal just before arrival in JFK. No other meal in between for this almost 15 hrs journey except a biscuit size pizza slice.  I pre ordered hindu non veg meal. During food service, I informed the cabin crews about my change of seat, but one crew served me a packet saying Hindu non-veg meal which was not hindu meal. My all other family members got different foods in their hindu meal.  The most confusing in the  journey was Emirates hotel policy. I booked a ticket from Emirates website with fare basis economy saver and 13 hrs stop over in Dubai having no shorter connection. My family members purchased same economy save ticket with almost same fare but from agents and they got Dubai Connect voucher. I suggest Emirates to provide the hotel eligibility during the booking process. Probably, I would not book via Emirates website then. The only good thing in the journey was availability of wheel chair in all airport.",9,7th February 2020,India

It surpassed my needs and expectations by some margin! Bravo to all the crew. My most relaxing and enjoyable flight ever!",1,7th February 2020,United Kingdom
380,"✅ Trip Verified | Customer service and good hospitality has gone out of the window for this money grabbing airline. Emirates airline failed to provide a refund for a ticket I paid for my 87 year old grandad who refused to fly on a 13 hour delayed flight. On the 13 hour delayed flight they looked after us in the UK but on the delayed 12 hour stay in Dubai they didn’t even offer us a bottle of water at the airport and then sent us to a terminal with no baby changing facilities or services for a 6 hours. I paid for a sub standard lounge myself out of necessity for my family but Emirates refused any hospitality or compensation. Inflight food was horrible. On the return journey the scones, clotted cream and jam was acceptable but the rest of the 6 meals we had on the other 3 flights were horrible. Emirates beef and mash - meat was too large and overcooked to be edible, sauce saltier than sea water and a salad of sweetcorn. Emirates directly employed staff are great but third party ground handling staff are horrible. No customer service skills at all shown in Mumbai. They didn’t even offer a buggy for my child in a massive airport and then went on to charge me an extortionate amount for 17kg excess baggage. No hospitality in Dubai, forget a lounge, no information communication or water when delayed with a family. Their profit grabbing has lead to a simple burger and fries meal costing £20 for 1 person and a sub standard lounge at £180 at my expense! By far the worst airline from the airlines I have been on: Etihad, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines, South African airlines, Air India, Turkish Airlines, Indigo, BA and Cathay. Contact customer service and receive nothing citing rules where they can basically extortion money from trapped passengers. Ridiculous, never ever again.",8,4th February 2020,United Kingdom
381,"✅ Trip Verified | Venice to Dubai via Singapore. One or two of your female flight attendants when serving did not talk to the passenger. One lady attendant just simply waited for me to ask the passenger next to me what she wanted for her drink. Some of your staff were really quite unwilling to even say ""Goodbye"" or ""Thank you"" when we were leaving. This is really unacceptable in the service industry.

The service is non existent and if you want a drink of alcohol you have to call or go to a section in the aircraft where you have to ask.

384,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Islamabad. I upgraded my return from Dubai to Business Class and to get lounge access in Dubai. In a nutshell, my experience of the lounge and the flight was underwhelming. The Emirates Business Class lounge at Dubai airport, although huge, is dated and so big that it becomes inconvenient.  Huge, but so convenient to navigate so one has to keep walking, hoping to find anything. The food was average. The service was courteous. The flight was not even 3 hours but what really made it an unpleasant experience was the attitude of the air hostess serving my side. The welcome on board was anything but warm. I thought, maybe they are busy and it will get better. I am short and had a heavy backpack and a duty-free shopping bag in my hand. I was struggling to open the overhead bin but she did not offer to help me or open the bin for me. On the contrary, when I asked where to put it she just gestured and ignored that I was in a pickle. Thankfully, a fellow passenger got up to help me. The air hostess's attitude continued for the rest of the flight - once she was passing by and I stopped her for a glass of water and she almost did an eye roll when she stopped. I did not pay extra for this. Honestly, my experience with Emirates Economy when going to Dubai was better than this. The biggest turn off is a staff with an attitude. Fine, they probably do not like the Dubai to Pakistan sector but that is not my fault. We pay a good amount and honestly, it does not take much to be nice and courteous. So disappointed, especially when I thought Emirates business class would be the best experience. The 2-3-2 configuration is poor, the wifi never worked,. Going to avoid this from now onwards.",1,3rd February 2020,Pakistan
385,"✅ Trip Verified |  We had a flight from Tehran to Auckland via Dubai in January 2020. Due to the Ukrainian flight crash, our flight was rescheduled twice by Emirates, which means we had to have 20.5 hr of stop in Dubai. We called the airline office in Tehran to see our options of accommodation in Dubai. They said yes due to a stop longer than 13 hrs the airline must provide accommodation for you but they didn’t have access to the hotel booking system and asked us to address this issue in emirates airline counter in Dubai airport. We arrived in Dubai and asked about the hotel booking option. Surprisingly they said we cannot have any accommodation provided by airline, and it is not their problem! We had arguments about the airline policy and they were refusing to show us the policy and just giving us some wrong information that it is in their policy and they cannot provide accommodation. After 2 hrs of discussion and argument, they finally provided a twin room for three people. We were really disappointed. I had a surgery on my neck about two weeks before the flight which and had to ask the cabin crew to open the head locker for me. I asked one of the crews for the first time, he opened the head locker for me and said “don’t ask me again to do that for you, I’ve got back pain!”. I won’t fly with Emirates anymore.",4,1st February 2020,New Zealand

Although both with the older versions, with the slightly curious bar area, the cabin crew were excellent – efficient, courteous and chatty. The Emirates lounge in Bangkok is excellent with a good selection of food and drink, including champagne, and boarding was handled efficiently with business passengers having their own line. As ever with this route, the Wi-Fi connectivity varied – at times it was very fast and others did not work at all. Food on the flight was tasty and the crew were diligent in ensuring that glasses were topped up. The connection in Dubai was easy, without any terminal change, and the lounge gave easy access to the aircraft.

On both legs, crew was unfriendly and not very welcoming. The senior crew member on the outbound leg was exceptionally kind, but for the rest of the team it felt like they were just fulfilling a duty. On the return flight, the crew member got my drinks and food order wrong twice - and when I pointed it out, she looked annoyed as if it was my fault.

When bassinet were installed it is impossible to use table to tv. There is a trolley on airport but it is not suitable for younger than 6 month babies. There is no gate check for your own trolley. They do not accept it. I contacted and asked if i can checkin my carry on luggage which is so common for other airlines, they said i can but while getting boarding pass they did not accept it, so i had to go with 3 carry on luggage and baby seat in. Over all the going flight was not good. On the way back the first flight was delayed and i had less than 40 minutes to catch next flight and staff was helpful. Even though the flight had 50 minutes delay in take off. The return flight was better and we had better seats but tv and airconditionning issue still the same.

The host assured me Emirates had the ability to hold any flight for up to one hour, and that we would make our connection. We arrived only to find we had missed our connection by 20 minutes. We were devastated, as this was the only flight out that day, and were told we would have to spend 24 hours in Dubai. There was no one on the ground to help us, so we made our own way to customer service. The staff were rude and completely unapologetic that we would lose 24hrs from our vacation. They told us to go to the hotel and didn't give us any guidance as to how to get our baggage, or even where our baggage would end up. The flight they rebooked us on allocated us seats at the back of the plane, as if losing 24hrs wasn't punishment enough. We then spent a further 3 hours at the airport, trying to get our seats moved and also secure our baggage. Even more concerning than all of this, there was no guidance around what it meant to enter the UAE and what we should be careful of medication-wise. When we went through customs to enter Dubai, they searched my bag and started questioning myself and my husband for sleep medication I had with me. It was incredibly disturbing and made even worse later finding out my husband had both Benedryl and pseudoephedrine - two over the counter drugs that are jailable offences in the UAE without a prescription! This is a complete lack of duty of care by Emirates.  This is disgusting behavior and not what I expect of what is said to be a premium airline.

One criticism – which was shared by other passengers and indeed cabin crew we spoke to – is the appalling choice of music played when boarding the aircraft. We heard a number of songs dating back to the 1970s and 1980s which we had hoped we would never hear again. Although boarding was efficient, exiting was more chaotic. The problem is that both business and economy passengers are converging on the same exit which meant that it took an inordinate amount of time get off the aircraft.

395,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to New York via Dubai. For this trip to JFK we decided to travel 1st time with emirates. On the departure date the journey was more than 21 hours from Singapore. The staff in the plane were arrogant and unhelpful. They were unwilling to help even for taking hot water for my other baby to make milk. Imagine requesting for hot water for baby milk (1st time on to the flight) and was greeted with an unhappy face from the crew. This is not during the period where everyone were required to remain seated. We are family of 8. Our baby 24 mths old and 4 mths old were not making things easy. The staff was rude to us from the start.  We were not demanding passenger nor were we rude at any time. We had on many occasions called them by pressing the button but at all times nobody came to our seat to attend to us. This is far from what we called excellent service coming from an international airline.  They told us to put up the hand carry luggage ourselves when my 13 yr old daughter had difficulties on 1 occasion. On another occasion there were clean pair of socks on the floor and they told us to clean that up. I was appalled by the choice of words they used. They even make unhappy faces when we requested for drinks as kids were thirsty. I am not a big eater but even i find that the food provided was insufficient in portion. We should have been served a proper meal for the last meal but instead we were given a small piece of pizza. As we were all very hungry on that day and Halal food was difficult to find at JFK airport we had to travel very far to have our meal at Philadelphia, the only place we know there were authentic halal food.

396,"✅ Trip Verified |  Stansted to Singapore via Dubai. The flight was long and arduous due to flooding at Dubai airport. This was obviously out of Emirates control. However the lost my bag, and as I was travelling on official business I was forced to purchase a replacement suit and medication. I first rang the emirates number in Singapore and spoke to an individual who told me they would email about the case. No email arrived. A week later I was passing through the airport again and went to the Emirates desk. The member of staff was incredibly rude, and informed me it was nothing she could help with (in fact she just sat shaking her head for most of the conversation). I then rang the Singapore number again and the member of staff informed me I would have to complain. I explained that I did not want to complain, but was just looking to have a normal conversation with a member of staff. The cost of the replacement clothes was modest. Anyway, I then used the feedback form online to send my request, and received nothing back after 3 days. Emirates do not provide an email address. My next step was to speak with someone on online chat function, who informed me it could take up to 30 days to respond to my complaint. I expressed incredulity at this number. My only conclusion is that Emirates does not do customer service - unless that is, you want to buy a business class ticket. It has been a very frustrating and sorry affair. The lack of clear information, mixed messages, is very frustrating. Individual members of staff seem to have no authority to deal with a problem, which speaks to a dysfunctional and frustrating work environment.",1,23rd January 2020,United Kingdom

The aircraft was well-decorated and the legroom was satisfying. nThey have the best inflight entertainment system. The tickets were relatively cheap. The cabin crew were generally friendly. Dubai is not a passenger-friendly airport. It is quite frustrating to travel around. The airport is  massive but the train does not run through the entire airport. The cabin crew had not been too eager to serve. They sat in the galley for most of the time. When a passenger needed anything, instead of hitting the bell, they went to the galley and ask for their needs. The toilets were quite dirty. Although it takes 8 hours to fly from Hong Kong to Dubai, they only serve two meals (one hot and one cold).  Passengers needed to wait for 6 hours for another meal.",2,17th January 2020,Hong Kong
401,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Mexico City. I boarded Emirates flight EK255 at Barcelona airport. We were assigned D19 gate, once the boarding started they made us go down a spiral staircase to the exterior, to wait for a bus to arrive after fifteen minutes to a far away location from to board by steps.  The unacceptable fact is that once the passengers got off the bus, soaking under the storm, the crew hindered the traffic, stopping the passengers outside the airplane access door to check their documents before allowing entry, despite having credited our access at the boarding gate and when boarding the bus. It is ridiculous that security measures are so poorly coordinated that they need to check the boarding passes three times. After twenty minutes under the rain, I managed to enter the plane. Before occupying my seat seat -7K- right next to the door, a second flight attendant asked me for my boarding pass, preventing me from sitting until I showed it.

402,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to San Francisco via Dubai. I traveled to San Francisco  for important business meetings. After experiencing almost 4 hours of delays I was informed on my arrival (12 Jan. 2020) in SF, Emirates informed me that my baggage had been lost. I was asked to complete a form and was told that the bag would be delivered to my hotel the next day. This was already upsetting because I didn't have clean clothes and would be attending my first meeting the following morning. I was forced to buy a clean set of clothes. After being told that Emirates would be in contact with me, and having heard nothing from the company I decided to call them later that day, only to find out that my baggage would only arrive the next day (14 Jan. 2020). As upsetting as this was, I didn't want to spend more money to rectify their mistake, so I borrowed a set of clothes from my colleague for our meetings the following day. Once again, not hearing anything from Emirates, I called them the morning of the 14th to ensure that everything will be taken care of. However, when I returned to my hotel later the afternoon my bag still was not delivered. Once again, I called Emirates just to hear that there was not anything they could do to resolve my issue, I was simply asked to wait. Now I will have to spend more money fixing their mistake. The lack service, communication and professionalism I received from Emirates has been distasteful. There has been no effort from their side to rectify their mistake, which is appalling for a company who consider themselves a leader in business travel. For this reason, I believe one should rather avoid using their services if you are time-pressed and have important meetings to attend.",7,15th January 2020,South Africa

This is unacceptable as the decision for that was taken out of my hands. Having arrived at the boarding gate on time and being told that my seat was given to someone else was upsetting.

410,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. KL to DXB has no issue at all. Was a smooth aircraft n service. The meals and services were good. But the problem has started with flight EK001 while flying to London. I already booked a preference seat and also requested a special hindhu vegetarian meal choice. But without my consent, there was a couple sit in my seat and asking me to exchange the seat. I didn't made any argument just accepted without any sorry and thanks from them. Later on when the special meals (veggie/kids meals) were distributing I have told a cabin crew that I made a special request for meals and exchange my seat. Please take note of it and give the meals to me to this new seat. After a second another crew came to me and begging at me said she wrongly delivered the food to the couple and accept her apologies. Still, I was keeping my calm. Later on, they offered me a bun which contains eggs. I've highlighted to the crew that Hindhu vegetarian meals doesn't contain beef and eggs. Why didn't check my request before distributing the foods. The crew came again and said  sorry.  Now same 2nd incident happened while from UK to Dubai on 31/12/19 on EK008. While the breakfast distributing I found my meals contain eggs. During lunch meals, a crew came and told me that she forgot my veggie meals request and I was offered a fruit platter. Sadly I cannot enjoy just a pineapple alone, I just avoided.  My next flight EK344 didn't offer welcome drinks and meals / snacks before landing. Emirates we pay the hefty price the service.

The Emirates lounge at AKL airport is the best I have visited. Best food etc, easily. Unusually, the Emirates lounge at Dubai was fairly underwhelming. Huge, but poor food choices etc, rather mediocre for a hub of that size.

A couple of years ago business class of Emirates and Qatar were similar but Emirates is sliding down a bit while my experience with Qatar Airways is always top. This time both flights were really not okay: Crew showed no or little interest in you and was chatting in the galley; before, cabin staff  introduced herself to each passenger, not anymore; ICE system not working properly, finally this was solved by a stewardess. Food not bad, but average, no hot towels before takeoff; no amenity kit anymore, new business class with 3 middle seats is strange choice, and claustrophobic, certainly middele seat.

Aside of the caviar, despite Emirates still not give pearl spoons, the food could be better. For first class it was just Ok - despite the very friendly service. Emirates is very generous with the drinks in first, refills, dessert wines digestives. I did not ask for the breakfast - it was too early for me 4.30AM Dubai time. Passengers do get a pyjama and decent amenity bag. In a 777 there are 2 restrooms for a maximum of 6 people, however the space is very limited.

Painless check-in which combined with smooth boarding ensured the wheels left the ground precisely on time, underlining what can be achieved by a competently managed airport and airline working harmony. Young mostly male crew responsive to specific calls but not seen much otherwise, e.g., water rounds during the night. Two good vegetarian meals let down by the enshrined practice of UAE major carriers of treating requesting special meals with antipathy if not contempt, no drink service and trays not collected for 2 hours or more.

Flying to Sydney this year it’s clear to see an awful lot of cost-cutting at play with the Economy Class product. While EK will get you from A to B in relative comfort, gone are the days of personalised service, care for passengers or the little perks that used to make travelling with them so great – with items such as hot towels having been ditched.

422,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Manchester. I find that when you fly Emirates you tend to get one of two types of experience in the Business Class cabin. You are either totally blown away by the friendliness and the level of service or you are totally underwhelmed and thinking that you should have spent your money elsewhere. This flight was the latter of the two. The crew could not be less interested in the passengers. They spent most of their time on the flight in the galley say down chatting amongst themselves. The flight was a night flight and they said it was a reduced service flight! I explained that I was hungry so they gave me two tepid seafood dishes - revolting. The A380 was a 2 class model and quite frankly had seen better days and looked in need of a clean. Emirates need to lift their game if they want to keep up with the likes of Qatar, Cathay, Asiana or even Qantas or Air NZ. This was a poor effort by them, they could not care less and it showed.",1,27th December 2019,Australia
423,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Dubai in first class was not amazing it was nice. The service was adequate, the seat was comfortable, the entertainment was what you expect on Emirates, i.e. lots of it but not any films that I  was really excited about, but enough to keep you entertained. The only thing for me on the flight that was a stand out was the catering that was very good, as was the wine selection - which strangely enough was not top shelf wines but very good middle of the road wine. What was bizarre for me was the lack of training in the food and wine that the crew had. Did not know the wines and served the caviar with a metal spoon. I asked for a bone spoon and they said that they did not have any - and when I pointed out that metal reacts with the caviar and that is why it is not normally used, they looked at me if I was from the moon. Also bad practice was making First passengers pay for wifi. The flight was a code share with Qantas and the crew kept telling me wifi was free if I joined their FF programme. When I pointed out I was Qantas they said oh well you have to pay then. I think that that Qatar Airways QSuite business class is a better product than the EK first class, but that is just me.

425,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York to Kolkata via Dubai. We were able to get adjacent seats in bulkhead, giving us a good bit of leg space and being at the edge in the centre section of a 3x4x3 layout, the flight to Dubai left us feeling less cramped. The plane was organized in a way that offered spaces to stand and stretch and the bathrooms on the flight to Dubai were tidy. We were served ample meals and liquor was provided on request. Snacks were laid out in the galley. The collection of films to view was huge -- in fact, selecting from this immense library was a challenge. Good head sets were provided. Flight attendants were friendly and I thought their uniforms were attractive. The wait at Dubai to connect to Calcutta was several hours but the airport is a shopper's paradise. I found the prices on liquor competitive and there were many international shops and eateries. The terminals were clean  with ample seating. The security check between flights was smooth. At JFK on boarding, a camera snapped our picture; the boarding passes themselves were not scanned. We had economy class tickets but on boarding at Dubai, we found a cabin crew member selling empty seats in business class. He had a mobile credit card reader. We paid for two tickets. The business class was in a 2x3x2 layout and was uncrowded.  The cabin felt old fashioned and the seats did not go to 180 degrees; it was angled, but comfortable nevertheless. Attendants were  very pleasant. Duty free shopping was available and I picked up a a few cosmetics. No landing cards were provided. Neither were any amenity kits, though a pair of socks and a eye shade in a plastic wrapper was in the magazine pocket. The TV screens were on the wall separating the biz class cabin from first class. All the flights were on schedule. Emirates does not belong to any of the big 3 alliances. The only US airline you can get points with is Jet Blue.

429,"✅ Trip Verified |  Trivandrum to New York via Dubai. I have been a regular customer on Emirates Airlines for the last 5 years and chose this airline over many others because of the great service in the past. However, in my most recent travels, I have experienced poor management of flight connections in Dubai Airport. Due to this, I have missed several flights to New York, have been stranded in Dubai for days, have lost or missed my baggage, or have had to run at top speed to barely make it to my gate on time. There is technically only a tight 1 hour and 15-minute layover in Dubai but lately, the flight from TRV to Dubai has been arriving 30-45 minutes late due to an inability to get a gate. This of course suggests poor planning and organizing on your airline’s behalf. This delay leaves about 20 minutes for us to deboard the plane, figure out our new gate, clear security (twice), and arrive at our departing flight. It is almost impossible to do this especially for customers who are first time travelers, older, disabled, or impaired. As an asthmatic, the marathon run I had to make from Terminal C to Terminal A led to bad wheezing and could have resulted in a medical emergency if I had not carried my inhaler. Several times, we only barely made our Dubai to JFK flight because we paid for preferred seats in the front of the plane allowing us to leave quickly. Despite experiencing this incredibly stressful connection, Emirates staff provides no support to help us off the flight quickly. In fact, on our December 12th flight when we alerted the flight attended about our very tight connection (EK201 was already boarding when we landed), she dismissively told us “everyone has a connection flight not just you”. She also argued with my father and I for 5 minutes further delaying our exit from the plane. This is poor management and could be remedied by announcing the names of passengers with very tight connections. However, it seems Emirates no longer cares about their customers. Due to our marathon run, we did make our flight on December 12th, but my relief was short-lived. We were informed that all 3 of our checked bags were not loaded and would instead arrive on EK203 on December 13th at 8:00 am. On December 13th, I called the Emirates number for baggage services at 9am and was told my bags had arrived and JFK and needed to clear customs before it was delivered to my home. I was also informed that I would be updated on my baggage status- which did not occur. My family and I were put through hell to get our baggage back. We had to contact Emirates 5-7 times within the day. At one point, a chat service agent gave us conflicting information insisting that our baggage was still in Dubai despite being told otherwise many times. Ultimately after and exhausting flight and while still jetlagged we had to stay up until 2:30 am calling both Emirates and the delivery company (Bex) every hour till our bags were delivered. Due to the issues detailed above, my family and I have decided to no longer fly Emirates. . I used to be a loyal customer, but your company has really gone down the drain these past few flights and loyalty is not a good enough reason to suffer during my travels. Horrible Service. Horrible Airline.",9,16th December 2019,United States

Enough signage and staff on hand to point you in right direction. Pre-selected seats which cost AUD$100 all up, but via app was able to tweak them along the way. Before my return legs home I was even able to select seats in rows 47 and then 49 in economy which were previously showing as 'preferred' at a higher cost. I even managed to score spare seats next to me. If you can sit in this smaller section of #40's rows I recommend it as board a little sooner and off quicker as use the front door - just be aware of bassinets at the front.

432,"✅ Trip Verified |  I've been travelling Emirates for over a decade for work, am a Skywards customer, and have previously always been impressed with the quality of the services on board. However, in the last few years I've seen a decline in the food quality and lounge facilities, as access has grown dramatically. All this is fine, except for a recent incident which has convinced me it's time to switch to another airline for our long haul flights. This past year I was denied boarding on a Dubai-Kolkata leg of a flight while I was enroute to a wedding.  I requested not to be the ""random"" selection for denied boarding (due to overbooking). I was told as compensation I would be given a return ticket from Dubai to Calcutta, but I explained this had no value to me as someone who lives in Canada and is not based in Dubai. The Agent then  informed me that he had made a note on the file and upon ticketing it could be changed to a ticket from Dubai-Toronto upon calling in. I confirmed verbally with the agent 3 times. It was 2 am, and I retreated to get some sleep. Naturally when I went to use the ticket, I was informed this was not possible. However the Emirates ticketing agents informed me that the ticket could be used to fly from Dubai to Middle East destinations such as Syria, Iraq, Iran and Pakistan and then chuckled. I have spent multiple hours on the phone with Emirates agents trying to sort out the problem, and the service has ranged from excellent and understanding (thank you Connor in Manchester), to rude and gleeful at pulling a bit of a hoax on a customer. Ultimately Emirates refused to honour the guarantees made by the agent (in spite of conducting an investigation which did not result in findings that contradicted my statements), because their agent was a DNATA representative. In short, you cannot trust the folks standing under the Emirates sign at the check-in in Dubai, because Emirates itself will not back their guarantees. I am extremely disappointed, and have started flying Qatar Airways instead. ",1,10th December 2019,Canada

434,"✅ Trip Verified |  EK 318 from Dubai to Tokyo, Narita on 21st Nov 2019. This flight seemed to have issues right from the start. The Boarding gate where we were to board had several leaks so we had to try and huddle in the dry sections. There was not enough seating. Boarding was chaotic at best and anyone willing to lie about their Emirates membership got in first. The lady at the door was unable to cope. The cabin was dirty, the crew seemed to not know each other, 2 rows at the back in Economy were kept empty for the use of crew (at the cost of paying passengers and despite having a section for crew to rest and sleep) which despite my request they refused to relinquish. Rest of the passengers had to make do without the 6 extra seats. Apparently this is a regular reservation for the crew on this flight. I paid 350 Dirhams for a horrible seat with legroom only for my right leg. Photo attached. Crew shouted to each other about running out of meals, one crew member scolded the other members and paid very little attention to the general public. There was one apparently senior staff who did a royal walk through the cabin and only spoke to 3 or 4 people whom she chose, I am guessing at random. Lastly they took away blankets an hour before landing and then piled them into bags. So again customer was last. It was cold and we were still an hour away.

The staff asked me to put my luggage on the weight. They said my luggage was too heavy, they fined me. Of course, it was reasonable to be fined if someone's luggage is over weight, and even though my luggage was over weight, they talked to me in a very rude way.

I had to really struggle to get a simple cup of tea from them. It seems like they don't realize they are there to work and provide a service for passengers.,1,5th December 2019,United Arab Emirates
438,"Not Verified |  Singapore to Madrid via Dubai. This is our first flying with a Emirates and I would say this is one of the worse airlines I have been. Traveling as a family of four with two you g children; we were told That we will be seated together. To our dismay our seats were separated. We were seated at the window and aisle with a stranger in between. When we raised our concerns, the staff just gave us a shrug and said that we could speak to the person and asked if they would like to change exchange their seats so at least both my kids could be seated with me. Every other airlines would be more than happy to help us in rearranging the seating arrangements and will be the ones doing the asking. However, Emirates staff were just too busy gossiping in the galley to care much about the comfort of their passengers.",1,4th December 2019,Singapore
439,Not Verified |  Very disappointed with this airline. The service is very poor and some cabin crew can appear disinterested. I previously used Ethiopian Airlines which has excellent service levels and was expecting similar service and better from Emirates and was sorely disappointed. The fleet used in intra-Africa flights (between Lusaka and Dubai in my case) have tiny seats and I was squashed and worried for my safety as I was in a row of three with a very large guy in the middle and I couldn't rest comfortably and was worried about getting injured. I'm used to old fleets used for intra-africa flights but Emirate seats are the smallest I've experienced. It was the worst flight ever. The cabin crew can miss rows when serving meals or drinks and it's just an annoying service. Although my flight from Dubai to London was on a new fleet with comfortable chairs what didn't change was cabin crew service which was still poor. The food is also average. I expected so much and had high hopes and was very disappointed. All style with no substance. Ethiopian Airways is better service but just shame that transit times at Bola international are so long and you can't always check-in online!,1,2nd December 2019,United Kingdom
440,"Not Verified |  Dubai to Stockholm. Excellent check in at DXB,  separated from Economy class passengers.  Business lounge in DXB has really poor offers for breakfast. Disappointed. Boarding not great. Business class passengers have to give priority to economy class. Strongly recommend Emirates to change policy. I felt the seat is narrow (2x3x2 seating in business class). No such experiences with CX, SQ, LH, BA or SK. Extensive film and CD selection, but the info and guidance (for choosing films) in the paper Magazine were irrelevant. Hence, ended up listening to Beatles and Led Zeppelin. Strongly recommend Emirates to present the films in a better way. For lunch there was a selection and obviously made I the wrong choice. Cannot blame Emirates but other passengers are recommended to make safer bets.",1,1st December 2019,Sweden
441,"✅ Trip Verified | Glasgow to Dubai. My husband and I use Emirates twice a year to fly to Dubai because it’s direct with good times and have done for many years. Sadly we have found that the last few trips the service is lacking. Yes you are greeted on arrival but that is as far as the service goes. From getting a hot towel and nuts before take off to getting a menu and scowl. On this return trip after the meal was served the drinks trolley was coming up the aisle, then the stewardess stopped three rows ahead of us and wheeled past and never returned. I do feel that rather than standing gossiping with each other in the galley the stewards/stewardesses should be going round their section making sure their passengers are ok and not waiting to be summoned. The food is really not as good now either. Always curry, which is fine now and again but not all the time. The coffee is weak and horrible too. Lots of corners being cut but prices going up. Also the rewards scheme is a joke as we will never have enough to save to make proper use of them. As I mentioned the only reason we like using this airline is the good flight times and they are direct but we are considering flying with BA in future.",1,28th November 2019,United Kingdom
442,✅ Trip Verified |  I regret my last trip Kolkata to Dubai. The staff did not even greet. They carried a really bad attitude & a zero customer service. The food was left over as I dint like it.

When I was boarding from Dubai they weighed my hand luggage again and asked to pay for my Duty-free shopping which is 4 kilos. I said this is my sweater and chocolate which I bought duty-free. They said we can consider 1-kilo rest you have to pay for it otherwise you can return your duty-free shopping. Moreover, you have only 15 minutes on your hand. If you can’t come back you will miss your flight. I tried to explain, I’m from London and always fly on Emirates it’s only 4 kg extra which is duty-free. I already weighed from London. Then they became so rude and gave me options pay for 3 Kg or throw away your products. I paid AES 240 which is around £50.

447,"Not Verified |  Dubai to Milan. Emirates normally provides excellent service, yet one weak link staff member could damage the airline’s image. Although, gold customers, we entered, from the business lounge to upper deck holding economy tickets, owing to Gate boarding directions. The boarding staff was unwelcoming, rude and arrogant, over what he wrongly perceived was our error, not Emirates’ operations. Worse still. Indicating clear distress, from my recent spine injection, he said “that doesn’t matter”. Leaving me to carry me, with no assistance from aircraft staff, to change levels. Once seated, we could hear the clunks from others changing levels, so we were not alone.  My wife and I were considering upgrading at the service desk. It was unattended and the flight was late and no alternative access appeared to an economy gate was closed or not properly indicated. Miserable staff member, this flight only.

449,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Kolkata via Athens and Dubai. During the flight from Athens to the Kolkata Emirates damaged my suitcase.  Right when I collected my suitcase from the airport baggage collection conveyor I noticed this and brought to the attention to Emirates staff.  I had to wait approximately 90 min for someone from Emirates to fill out appropriate forms, copy my boarding pass and passport. Then Emirates told me that someone will get back to me within 24 hours. They called me after 3 days and asked for the receipt of the bag. I emailed them the receipt promptly the same day. Then Emirates staff said, Emirates will process my request and will contact me after a few days. Then after a couple of weeks, they contacted and asked to get back the damaged bag in order to send me the compensation. I was away from Kolkata and told them that I am away from Kolkata and it will be tough for me to go to Kolkata airport to give the bag, what if they collect it from me after I go back to the USA. They said okay. After coming back I contacted Emirates via phone and the customer service responded with the utmost courtesy and apologized every time for the delay and promised that someone will get back to me within 24 hours. Emirates never got back to me. I wrote several emails to emirates customer service with incident # and reference #, not a single response I ever received. It is a nightmare. Just a terrible service.",1,10th November 2019,United States
450,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kathmandu to Gatwick via Dubai. Emirates are mis selling these flights. The Kathmandu to Dubai leg is with FlyDubai, their budget airline. No mention is made of this when booking the tickets. The flight between Dubai and Gatwick was great as you would expect and the FlyDubai was fine for a budget airline BUT I didnt realise I was booking a budget airline. It's in a totally different terminal with minimal facilities and you need to allow 1 hour to transfer. If I was only travelling between Dubai and Kathmandu fine but I had a 5 hour wait in a sparse terminal after an overnight flight. Then was on a budget flight, no offer of even water until we were 1 hour into the flight. No problem with budget airlines if its what I choose but I and everyone I spoke to about the second flight felt we'd been tricked by Emirates.",10,8th November 2019,Nepal
451,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Athens. This has been my worst flying experience.  I received an email to check into my flight from Newark to Athens, which I did hours before my flight. Due to a glitch in the system, the app failed to provide me with a digital boarding pass but confirmed that I was checked in. I figured that I would print my boarding pass when I got to the airport so I didn’t worry too much about it. Upon reaching the airport I go to the clerk to print my boarding pass and she tells me that I am not checked in. I show her the confirmation in my phone from their app confirming that I am checked in and for whatever reason she cannot seem to find me in their system. So I ask her where's the kiosk so that I can quickly check myself and come to find out, Newark airport has no Emirates kiosk and the lines are flooded with passengers? I tried my hardest to inform the Emirates representative at the desk that I was indeed checked in but she informs me that because she doesn’t see me in their system I cannot board the plane. So I pleaded with the woman to tell me what I needed to do to get checked in and she told me that the only way to check in is to do it through their app. I asked if I could speak to a manager or call Emirates, and the rep tells me that there is no time because the plane is about to take off. So even though I arrived in time for my flight, I was now late for my flight, and I was unable to board. I call Emirates and I was informed that I would have to purchase new tickets  or just pay a no show fee which is $400 per person plus additional fees. Which came out to $850 per person. Which actually added up to just purchasing new tickets. The thing is I not only had more than one hotel booked but I also had a connecting flight that I would also inevitably miss a well as other arrangements so I lost time, money, and had to spend more money to purchase two new tickets, also two more plane tickets when i reached Athens to finish my travel. At this point I'm infuriated and disgusted because I do not live by Newark airport, I live 1hr and 20 mins away, so not only did I miss my flights including a whole nights stay at some of my hotels, and my flight from Athens, I was stranded at this airport. ",5,5th November 2019,United States
452,"✅ Trip Verified | Sydney to Rome via Dubai. The services on the flight were beyond disappointing. I was recommended Emirates by friends and colleagues, as the best business class from Sydney to Europe. I was beyond disappointed when returning. Having flown to Europe business class for work and leisure with Singapore Airlines, Qantas and Etihad, and having flown business class to other locations on Hawaiian and Latam, I was very surprised to be so dissatisfied with the service and quality I received from Emirates, having been recommended by many colleagues and friends. I was disappointed to discover that the 14-hour flight from Dubai to Sydney did not have a lie flat bed (nor did Rome to Dubai, however, this was only 5 hours). More importantly, the service was appalling. My salad was rotting (attached photo) and my entrée was still frozen (attached photo). My TV repeatedly broke down during the flight (attached photo). The flight was largely full, so we could not be moved to another two seats seated close to one another. After raising this and the other issues with the crew, she became quite rude. Beyond our experience on the flight, upon boarding the flight at Dubai we were delayed as a result of the poor organisation at the airport for the duty-free items we had purchased in Rome. We had to provide these to be boxed and sealed, which was not the issue. The person who was doing this task, kept our boarding passes for the purposes of printing the tags to put on the boxes. However, we saw people who arrived after us, receive their boarding passes and board the flight before us, notwithstanding repeatedly asking for the gentleman to return our boarding passes to us so that we could board. Eventually, we were able to board, but only after first and business class had boarded and about half of the economy cabin. Finally, we did not receive any form of confirmation regarding our chauffeur from Sydney Airport to our home address, adding further to our stress as we were required to chase this to make sure it had been arranged. Having flown business class with various carriers, I was not impressed at all by the return flight to Sydney on Emirates in comparison. Business is not just about extra space, but about the extra service. The extra space was far from what is equivalently offered by other airlines, given the absence of a lie flatbed. Adding to that the poor service, I did not receive the benefits expected of business class, but instead economy. Since then, I have tried to liaise with Emirates to resolve the issue. After an offer of points which wouldn't even be enough for a single short-haul domestic flight, they informed me that they had made their 'final offer' and closed off correspondence. I would strongly recommend flying anything other than Emirates. Their service is terrible, before, during and after the flight and falls short of what is comparably offered.",3,5th November 2019,Australia

There was a stopover in Athens on Flight from Dubai to Newark and it was unpleasant. Any directions or help during this transit were non-existing and you'd need to go through at least 4 through security and immigration. I have flown Qatar Airways quite a bit and it is much much better than Emirates. It doesn't matter if you have new jets or terminals - if your staff is rude, it will lead to an awful flying experience.

465,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Amsterdam via Dubai. Disappointed with the experience in general. I have flown with Emirates since the last 15 years & was easy to see how the service has gone downhill. The cabin crew (with an exception of a few) didn't seem interested in their job, no sign of any courtesy what so ever. I felt as if they are doing us a favour letting us fly on their airline, sorry but we paid for our seats, it wasn't a free ride.  On a specific incident, during food service from Dubai to Amsterdam, noticed that the cabin crew ran out of lunch options from the two sets ahead of me, which is understandable. However the cabin crew still kept asking the following passengers including myself what would we like to have only to bluntly respond back that they have run out of options. Just couldn’t understand why was she asking what we passengers would like to have when she did not have any option in the first place? This was repeated over and over again finally asking the two passengers next to me. When I questioned her about this, she had no answer, soon after I could clearly see her behaviour towards me was immediately inhospitable, she even walked passed me without asking if I needed to have a tea or coffee. I didn’t care about the tea or coffee, but guess what it did leave me with a bad taste for the airline, besides I do get to have the last say by inputting a poor score on the infotainment screen at the end of the flight, which I did. Cabin crew of airlines thank or greet their passengers while disembarking, however noticed that some of the cabin crew in Emirates didn’t seem to bother. On a positive note, the ground staff are great & at least courteous, something that is missing once you get on flight. Emirates seriously need to re-train cabin crew to at least put on a pleasant look on their face, let alone a smile, most of the crew look grumpy & unhappy with the job they are doing.",1,16th October 2019,Australia

However, I have never come across such rude and hostile ground staff who have nothing to say but threats. They tried to play police and treat their customers like criminals. Customer service is simply non-existent. They rushed me to clear my bag or they were going to take me off the flight. Their hostile words were uncalled for and they kept telling me the gate was going to close, as if they were so hard-up on my money since every extra kg is 39 euro. I didn't want to argue with them as I know it was not the resolution. In the end, I paid over 100 euro as I wouldn't want to speak any further with them, and just wanted to get home.

472,"Not Verified | Had a disastrous experience with Emirates recently. I was supposed to fly from New Dehli to Dubai on a direct flight taking off at 9:50 pm. When we just arrived at the airport with my colleague we learned already that the flight would be delayed and ETA planned at 00:00. Just 15 min before the planned new departure, still no news. I had to go and try to get some info to be informed by chance that the flight has to land in Lucknow - 40 min away from Dehli for weather conditions. But a few more minutes to refuel and the flight would bridge at Dehli. Planned new departure: 1:40am. We then learned around 1:20 am that the flight would be delayed until 7:30 PM.with no further explanations. The whole crowd started to get mad, complaining vocally to the staff who had no explanation to give. I learned by chance again afterwards that the flying staff was on too many extra hours and had to rest before re-flying. Emirates did not anticipate this obvious issue that made the flight to Dubai impossible for a long time. After more than 1 hour of complaining and shouting, and no answers from the staff, a passenger took the lead and had to inform everyone that anyway our only solution would be to collect back our luggage and try to find an alternative flight if any. I decided to call Emirates who booked me on the 11 am flight as the 4:14 am flights with all the mess around would not be catchable for any of us despite the fact that 26 seats were still available due to the boarding pass issue. It took us another hour to go through the passport control back in a chaotic situation and finally get our luggage back. Emirates claimed that they would offer us a hotel and breakfast. But getting out of the airport we discovered that the 360 passengers we waiting on a parking lot for buses to come to drive us 40 min away from the airport. It would take 2 hours to get our room and it was already 4:30 am. We decided to avoid the mess and stay at the airport with no sleep and not even a single bottle of water given by Emirates. At 7 am when we checked in again and complained about our dreadful experience, the staff claimed that it was well managed, Emirates offering us a hotel room and a breakfast. It drove me mad and I asked to talk to the most Senior Emirates staff member at the airport. I could not talk to him as he was busy in a meeting, not even considering the fair complaint of an angry customer. He just did not care! I am flying 100 days a year for the last 15 years and it is the most painful experience I had so far. Not only the situation was tough but the staff was totally incapable to inform us of anything, letting us wait for hours for nothing and only the buzz around informed us.

The chair directly in front of me had a broken mechanism so it kept lurching backwards throughout the flight - even during take off. What is by far the worst for me (and has been discussed by friends who have recently flown economy Emirates) is the lack of drinks. They seem to have removed the bar service, except the limited drinks served with meals. So, I calculated we spent 5 hours without drink when you calculate our 2 hour stop over (where we were battling previous delay so no time got airport drinks), to be sitting in an aircraft got almost 2 hours before drinks became available. It was uncomfortable and poor service. Eventually I went to find the drinks myself - and was offered the standard small sealed cup! Shocking to think such inconsiderate service is part of Emirates - made more irritating by the signs on the screen asking passengers to keep hydrated during flights by drinking water. One very poor hot meal and the first and most awful 2 finger sandwich offered on a 7.6 hour flight - awful. And the WiFi was non existent - another reason we normally book with Emirates.

The service is still outstanding, before, during and after the flight. But the flight experience not so much (besides the bar/lounge area which rocks!). The seats and bord entertainment in the A380 business class upper deck are old and outdated. Screens aren't good, user experience with the system isn't good, I had also trouble adjusting my seat and what I found the most annoying: before the start you are bombarded with advertising in Arabic and English - certainly not what I expect from a Premium Product. And the WiFi barely worked on the in and outbound flight.",1,10th October 2019,Germany
477,✅ Trip Verified | Our flight was amazing from start to finish. I always fly Emirates because of the fabulous hospitality. Both legs of the flight were fantastic. A staff member on our second leg of the journey from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur on the 6 Oct - EK 0344 gave us special treatment on the flight as it was my daughter’s 9th birthday. My kids were given a special cake in a lovely glass presentation with Polaroid photos to take home for memories. This staff member is the true face of Emirates service with a smile and amazing hospitality. Thank you from the bottom of our hearts!,1,8th October 2019,United Kingdom

The flight from Dubai to Mauritius MK0911 is operated by Emirates, the flight was booked with Air Mauritius. Both companies when contacted to upgrade to business class prior to the flight declined they can do it (and this might sound not true but this was my experience), so even at check-in Emirates suggested the only way to get into business class is paying for the upgrade on-board. Emirates customer is not welcome to upgrade to business class on-board Although you may travel in business class paying for the upgrade last minute. The policy of Emirates is not to reward customers with business class mileage on last minute upgrades.",3,7th October 2019,United Arab Emirates

480,"✅ Trip Verified | I had heard a lot about Emirates and hence decided to fly with them. The cabin space looks okay, there are cabins with more space to walk around. On the Amsterdam to Dubai flight which was roughly 6.30-7 hrs - only 1 meal and a cold sandwich was served - in between there was no water served either. For such a long flight - it’s disappointing to not serve water at regular intervals - but it’s still the good part until now. Later at Dubai airport the staff were just bullies. Everyone was just asked to move from one place to other without much organisation and not respectfully but as cattleherd. There was a visually challenged man who was not shown any help or sympathy either. The connecting flight from Dubai to Bangalore just kept getting worse with people handing food parcels out by hand saying my colleague will bring the tray etc. Very very bad experience. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone especially if travelling economy class - they treat you as cattle. ",10,4th October 2019,India

Inflight entertainment not working properly, screen overheated regularly. Unfortunately we paid nearly $700 extra at booking, for specific seating selection and did not get any of the seats we paid for, on both outgoing and returning flights. Not given any explanation for this. If you can't accommodate people because of manifesto issues, totally understandable, but don't offer the option!!",6,3rd October 2019,Australia
482,✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai. We found the flight attendants rude. When we were arriving in Sydney people were going to the kitchenette and collecting the arrival cards but when my husband asked for one he was told that they would be distributed soon. The cards were distributed on the other side of the cabin. We did not get a card when we asked the flight attendant we were told we don't need it now in Sydney. When we asked why the other side of the cabin got embarkation cards he then said they ran short of cards and only had the cards in Arabic Language. We then asked him why he did not say in the first place that they ran short of cards in English. He was plain rude. We were at the rear of the plane and they just did not care. Emirates pride themselves of having flight attendants from 35 countries but most of them found it difficult to smile - no customer service. The food was not edible.

She could see I didn't even had a tissue since she clear all away. Didnt even care to bring tissue immediately. Later after she finished all her task then she brought wet wipes.

486,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Mumbai. I am in the UAE for the last 5 years but never had a chance to book Emirates as we always could book at the last moment when the prices were sky-high. This time as Jet Airways is no more, we were left with no choice than travel Emirates. Ours was a return journey and I wished the experience would never want us to look back for any other choice. But to our surprise, it turned vice-versa! To start with as soon as the flight started, the staff behaved like trainees. They didn't know where to start. We had a infant with us and it felt too cold. We pushed the for assistance 4 times but no one turned up! I had to go myself to ask for a blanket when I was asked to go and check at the back as she was too busy. When meal was served, I was asked for drinks. I asked for a beer which was not available immediately but I was told she would get it for me which never turned up. The whole thing was so unorganized. Not to mention the food was low grade. It would have been much better if they didnt actually keep the food. The flight landed even before we could be offered coffee. We thought may be this would be a one off case as we have always heard high words for the Emirates experience. On the way back the experience turned to be even worst. It started from the queue at the Airport! The online check-in queue was bigger than the normal check-in. Upon looking at the queue, we asked the representative if there is any priority for child in arm upon which we were told ""no"". Few minutes later we see a staff in the Emirates attire. When we went there as our child was crying, she rudely said that we should have asked her and the others are not Emirates staff as if it was our duty to train the outsourced staff of how to behave with their airline clients! Then in the flight the seat recliner didn't work and by the time they served the meal they had already exhausted the nonveg meal and beer.

When I went to the toilet I saw the staff putting away trolleys at the back of the plane and saw fresh apples. When I took my seat I requested an apple and was told that there is none.

I have flown Emirates First before which was similarly uninspiring - this flight confirmed for me to never bother again. Of course it was spacious and comfortable, couldn’t have been more so. The departure time of 5pm meant it was an ideal time to really enjoy a meal. There were only 6 passengers in First - me, another man and a family of 4 (including 2 young girls). So the cabin staff were hardly busy. After take off I did not see any uniformed flight attendants again, just a women in the serving ‘uniform’ who took food and drinks orders and served meals. She was incredibly surly and often just plain rude. For example, I when I asked for a simple champagne cocktail from the menu she rudely told me that it would take at least 15 minutes to make. Knowing that it only consisted of 2 ingredients I wasn’t deterred as she might’ve thought I’d be. The meal courses were roughly put down and she went through the motions of begrudgingly serving me. It occurred to me that maybe she was in a bad mood because all he colleagues had gone off to rest leaving her to do all the work. It was a very unpleasant experience for me. Not a single smile or kind, gentle word the whole flight.",6,25th September 2019,Australia

They're automated refunding system rejected it. Facebook media team just wasted time and didn't resolve it. Sending a complaint does nothing as this is an unmanned system it seems. Probably only there to mollify you. Multiple experiences over the years with Emirates ground staff and systems point to a organisation culture of arrogance. Lost luggage - no response; Broken baggage - no response; Upgrade point refund - no response; broken seats - no response; broken TV screens - no response; Slipping accident in their Milan lounge - no response; delayed flight and no onward booking organised - no response; Frequent flyer points unlisted - no response; Corporate entity details request - no response & the list goes on.

Since the flight was full and with only 1 middle row seat available, neither my wife nor I was comfortable to move leaving either me or my wife to tend alone to my toddler. Hence I decided to stay in the same seat. After an agonizing 12 hours with a stiff back I highlighted this to Emirates customer support who simply put their hands up stating that they helped but I refused. Firstly this seat should not have been allocated. This seat was actually allocated to my 5 year old. In that case Emirates was happy to move her alone to another seat!

499,"Not Verified |  Newcastle to Dubai. Having taken this flight for almost 4 years now, I have to display my displeasure over this most recent journey. Despite the flight leaving UK around lunchtime, the crew took the decision to turn down all the lights as soon as possible to pretend this was a night-time journey. What made the whole trip even more unbelievable, was the same exact thing occurred on the return journey even though departure from Dubai was 7:30am. I appreciate that Emirates used to pride themselves upon the free bar service for many years now, but to try and either save money by hoping people won't bother the flight staff if the plane is in darkness or the crews just decided to try for a quiet flight for themselves I don't really know. Being an elderly traveler (going to visit my son) I felt very uncomfortable trying to navigate my way to the bathrooms with very limited lighting. Passenger comfort and safety should always come before crew's desire for a quiet trip surely? Gone are the days where the crew would be traversing the plane regularly with drinks before, during and after the meal. I used to enjoy the spectacle, not that I took any alcohol anytime, it just seemed to break the journey down and make time pass faster. My son has submitted a complaint on Emirates website for me and has been sent only the standard ""We are looking into this"" email after almost 2 months now, so I assume they are not really interested in my comments - again, being a regular traveler on this route.",6,29th August 2019,United Kingdom

501,"✅ Trip Verified | BKK/HKG/BKK - In ten years of flying with Emirates business class on the short Bangkok to Hong Kong route I have rarely had anything other than an excellent flight. I just love the A380 aircraft and Emirates business class layout with the bar at the back. The decor is a bit plastic for my taste, but I take the airline for its unbeatable fares, its fantastic lounges with a quite amazing food and beverage selection, its on board service, the supreme comfort of the seating, the massive IFE selection and large screens. With first class dropped from this flight, the front of the upper deck now seats around 100 economy passengers. Yet the FA's usually make sure that these passengers remain seated whilst business class passengers can exit first. Given the economies that all airlines are now making, fast track cards are no longer handed out (not a problem for me as I have automatic fast entry at both airports), the main selection of the meal course is reduced to two offerings and the snacks in the bar are not as tasty as they used to be. But that is all rather irrelevant given all the pluses. On the outward sector I was too busy working to dine or use the IFE. I made do with a glass of the superb Cloudy Bay Sauvignon Blanc and a sandwich from the bar. Having eaten well in the lounge, I also declined the meal on the return flight but did enjoy this time a fine Pinot Noir and another chunky chicken sandwich. On this sector I watched a movie and still had time for some classical music before we landed ahead of schedule. For a few months, Emirates replaced the A380 with a 777 on this route. Hopefully the airline will continue with the A380 service for a long time to come.",1,25th August 2019,Thailand

Now I am calling each day trying to get necessary approvals for them to help me on my upcoming flight. Customer service is helpless, they are at the mercy of the Medical Assistance dept who are unreachable. They keep telling me that my onward journey from Dubai is on a code share airline - FlyDubai and that airline has to approve my medical condition before Emirates can do the same. I booked an Emirates flight in the USA and paid the airline. Emirates put me on a code share flight with FlyDubai. I filled out the medical form for Emirates airlines. How is it my responsibility to get approvals from FlyDubai and airline that does not do business in the USA or have a telephone number? Since Emirates is the primary airline they should get the necessary clearances from the other airline and get my special needs taken care of. The callous attitude of all the Emirates staff I have interacted with is shameful.

508,"✅ Trip Verified |  Christchurch to Sydney. Certainly not much positive to say about this airline other than the check in team were nice and efficient. All down hill from there, as we were delayed for take-off due to an ill passanger as soon as we had pushed back. No issue with illness, the problem was in Business no service was given to me even when after an hour I finally caught an attendant's eye for another drink and was abruptly told they were preparing for take-off again even though they were waiting on every whim of some other business guests. I'd paid for ""flexi business"" so not a cheap flight, yet the decor in the A380 is not to my taste of immitation golds, printed wood effect panelling with odd blue/grey seat shells, not relaxing or a calming vibe. Seats were otherwise comfortable, IFE remote is terrible for user functionality, and tray-table traps you in the seat so no mid-meal toilet trips. Crew were just a cog in the machine as they weren't personable and seemed distant to interact with everytime. My meal was quite tasty, another issue here was ordering Pinot Noir wasn't possible even simply asking for a red wine, still a blank stare so I gave up after multiple attempts as said pour whatever and ended up an musky white wine I couldn't drink. The attendands all understood English well, so it surprised me that it was so difficult to request a wine and even point at it on the menu! I was delayed and put up in a hotel for the night, however the shuttle driver only knew of one hotel to take us to and unfortunately only some of us were booked there. That hotel now full and multiple calls to Emirates, I was then told I was booked in a average hotel half-hour away even though I was the only Business guest and make my own way to the correct hotel. There weren't any Emirates members at the airport on the ground as many guests went around looking (myself included), so the only contact was once off the aircraft on the bridge an Emirates member told you which shuttle stop and a generic hotel name.

509,"✅ Trip Verified |  My first sector was from Madrid to Dubai. The purser on this flight was the crown jewel of the Emirates hospitality I remembered from my past travels. However she was assigned to business class whilst I was served by one crew who made my Emirates journey an utter disaster. The food on this flight was spectacular. The beef lasagna was great. The entertainment was limited compared to the newer A380s however it did have brilliant things that kept me entertained for 7 hours. Before take off I noticed that a customer who complained of a leaking AC was just shut down by a crew member who said 'cover your head for now, it'll stop after take off'. What a displeasing attitude from an airline renowned to be one of the best in the world.  At the meal service I noticed that meals run out when it comes to the seats at the back. The menu on that flight consisted of a chicken and beef option only, even though traditionally airlines of that calibre opt to offer a vegetarian option too. They had run out of the chicken option and my friend who for religious reasons does not consume beef, was forced with the beef option saying that was all they had. Whilst they refused to eat it, the crew who were called many times didn't even make a single appearance to enquire. Finally when it came to the pre arrival snack, they offered a chicken option and cheese option. The crew member just served the food without asking what I wanted. When I opened I realised I was given the tasteless cheese option. However, the passengers behind us were offered both where they had a choice.  My next flight was from Dubai to Colombo.

However, Emirates has decided to put the past behind and embark on a poorly schemed, appalling venture of cost cutting at the cost of passenger comfort whilst still charging passengers exorbitantly. The first sector was from Colombo to Dubai. It was quite acceptable that Emirates never focused on its Asian sectors for they have extreme confidence that it's competitive pricing and brand name would get them customers inevitably. Therefore, I boarded this old 777-300, the inflight entertainment was certainly not much of a great deal on the first sector with quite limited options and by trying to handle it's terribly dysfunctional remote and put it back into its position, the wire had cut my finger. It gave me the worst airplane food ever. The crew on this sector thought were the only appealing segments of what I would call the emisery. They were attentive and kind and maintained a smile but however did not go the extra mile like the qatar airways cabin crew who were an extreme delight. Furthermore, another factor that put me off completely was how narrow and uncomfortable seats were. It was a completely disastrous 4 hours and 10 minutes. The next sector was from Dubai to Zurich with a layover of about 2 hours and 30 minutes. The layover was quite bad with basically no one willing to help us in the airport.  we boarded a brilliant A380 that was the only thing as good as they advertise. Once again a repetitive episode of rude crew and even worse food.

I get there's a reason for those rules, but sometimes people should assess what makes sense and give a little leeway with small children.

We have traveled extensively with other airlines like Etihad, BA, and Lufthansa. But this time, unfortunately, we decided to buy a nightmare by paying way more than other good airlines. It all started with check-in baggage. The check-in counter crew demanded our passports without greeting or smile. In the past, some stuff was stolen from my bags so I asked them to put the zip ties on the locks. After I insisted she threw some plastic zip ties at me and asked to put them on the locks with a red face. They flew one of the filthiest A380 on the planet. The plane looked pretty old with dirty bathrooms and broken seats. I requested the Hindu meal for my family (three of us) and the steward only got two of the meals. I asked him politely about my meals and his response was ""I only got two hands"". Later he came back and said he accidentally gave it to someone else and I have to eat whatever they have left. I later talked to the head of the crew about the incident and she apologized and promised me that she will take care of the next meal. Nothing happened except now ""The steward"" giving us angry looks every time he passes by.

Five passengers in my group, the cabin crew refused to give us even one overhead space by rearranging the smallish purses or backpacks of passengers sitting elsewhere who had lavishly thrown them around! When requested at least one overhead space, curt reply was ""this space is for everyone"". So next time onwards I should throw my cabin bags in the first overhead space I find and then proceed to find my seat. Is that the message they are sending their passengers? I am connecting in Dubai from a previous leg on Emirates as well. It is better not to talk about the poor cabin service in economy class in the previous leg, but I should briefly mention. It was a 4 hour flight and cabin crew disappeared after serving meals in a hurry after about 90 minutes into the trip. A fellow passenger who asked for the second option on the regular menu was told that he will have to wait 15 minutes for that to be served. This while the crew was telling the passengers that only ""option one"" of the menu they passed out is available!

I had high Expectations from Emirates given their good reputation however when flying with them from Dubai to Bangkok the cabin service was rubbish. There was a 1 hour delay (Pakistani Airspace issues which is understandable) and no cabin members went around and offered us some water. After take off cabin service was generally lousy, They served us food and then vanished for the rest of the flight, when I buzzed an attended 2 hours in she comes up and says “eh sir your light is on just press it again to turn it off?.. I told her I just wanted a glass of water and I got it 10 minutes later, the same half bothered rude response was given the next time (2 hours later). I wanted a drink so I told her to get me 2 beers and I’ll leave them alone. The tables were not cleaned properly on this flight. The seats on the A380 were very soft and comfortable but they were rock hard on the Boeing 777 used for the Dublin flight. The ICE entertainment system has good music but doesn’t have good tv shows. On the positive side I had lots of legroom and my bags were delivered really quickly and handled well. Food and beverages were also good. I",1,24th July 2019,Ireland

Despite the lengthy flying hours I enjoyed the flight experience partly due to A380's ambience and quietness, but mostly due to the comfort of the seat, legroom and great in-flight food experience. The flight attendants were generous to give out snacks/drinks throughout which really helped. Having Wifi was revolutionary that ability of being able to connect to friends/family is  great! Having dual IFE screen on the IFE looked fancy but in the end it wasn't that interesting. The contents of ICE didn't live up to its hype to be honest.

520,"✅ Trip Verified | We flew with Emirates from Edinburgh to Singapore via Dubai. The segment between Edinburgh and Singapore was on a much older B777 wide-body plane. The seats do not lie 180 flat but at an angle. That is my main issue with the flight. The seat was so uncomfortable that I didn't get any sleep. The food was ok. The flight attendant was ok but lacking warmth. For instance, when I boarded the flight I handed over my jacket asking politely ""would you mind hanging this up for me"" to one of the flight attendants but was replied rather coldly that she would come back to me later. I understand that boarding is one of the busiest times for them but she was just not that friendly when she responded as if I was making an outrageous demand. However, the service in the second segment was better. Their A380-800 has an older fit-out and the stainless steel handrails make it really outdated but at least the seat lay flat 180 degrees and I managed to have a couple of hours sleep. The transit at Dubai airport was not a nice experience, the lounge is outdated and it was so crowded. It felt like being a cattle market. I wouldn't choose to fly with them on this route again especially the middle stop over actually breaks up the trip in half and you can not get a good long hours sleep.",1,20th July 2019,Singapore

523,"❎ Not Verified | Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I never liked Emirates, but due to last minute booking, Emirates was only available. All my fears came true. BKK - DXB: It was an overnight flight, so not much service required. Still, my monitor did not work, instead of rebooting it, I was offered to relocate myself. I did not want to do this; nothing happened with my monitor in 6.45 hours. Not a big issue, but shows the interest of the crew in real customer service. The crew was the most unpassionate and unpolite I saw in the last year. I look out for details and me even the uniforms were worn without proud and just looked untidy. It seemed like they were just angry and unhappy with their employer and shortsighted they make their passenger pay it. DXB lounge: just not up to a standard for a 3,000 USD ticket. Food average, furniture is worn out, staff unfriendly. DXB - IST: at last, the crew was friendly, and this was a good flight experience. Overall for Emirates became a luxury low-cost carrier, with overpricing in the high-end market. Economy class for sure is well worth the money you pay.",5,13th July 2019,Thailand
524,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuwait to Amman via Dubai on 3rd July 2019. If you ever depart from Kuwait and are flying Emirates, I’d strongly suggest using online check-in. At KWI, Emirates has a separate counter for online check-in passengers thus enabling passengers to skip the queue and proceed directly to the counter without having to wait. Be aware that during online check-in, you will not receive e-boarding passes if departing from Kuwait. I contacted Emirates and was told this is not an issue. At the counter, I received the boarding passes for both flights EK 856 (KWI-DXB) and my connecting flight EK 903 (DXB-AMM). The check-in experience was smooth, and within 10 minutes, I was through to immigration and security. Online check-in if departing from Kuwait is a lifesaver! First leg EK 856 from Kuwait to Dubai on the B777-300 ER. Boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. It was chaotic as expected for a fully-booked flight. Unfortunately, the aircraft was really old (registration A6-EBE). The screen was very small and ICE version was also very old. 3-4-3 configuration is not a favorite, and the seats felt narrow. Only 1 meal choice and no menus were given. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Kuwait due to late completion of boarding. Luckily, arrival in Dubai was only 5 minutes late despite the 30 minute delay departing Kuwait. If possible, book a seat on the left or right side of the aircraft (rows A, B, C or H, J, K). These seats will feel less cramped than seats in the middle (rows D, E, F, G). I was seated in seat 33A. Overall, a good flight although I’d avoid the EK B777 economy product all-together (unfortunately EK doesn’t fly the A380 to Kuwait so that’s not possible). Second leg EK 903 from Dubai to Amman on the A380-800. First time flying the EK A380! Again, boarding began 45 minutes prior to departure. The aircraft was definitely newer (registration A6-EOU). ICE version was newer and screen was much bigger. Still a 3-4-3 configuration however much more comfortable than the 777. Just like the previous flight, no menus were given and there was only 1 meal choice. Aircraft was 30 minutes late departing Dubai and arrival in Amman was only 3 minutes late. I was seated in seat 78K. Baggage claim at AMM was abysmal! I wonder if the problem lies with Emirates or the baggage handling system at AMM. I can’t really give them much blame due to the fact that the aircraft was an A380, but waiting 1 hour and 15 minutes for baggage delivery is still unacceptable! Also, in my opinion, Emirates should really rethink boarding times. Boarding an aircraft 45 minutes prior to scheduled departure time surely guarantees a delay. On EK 856, pushback was not until 15 minutes after scheduled departure time and on EK 903, pushback was not until 13 minutes after scheduled departure time! In my opinion, boarding should begin 60 minutes prior to scheduled departure time. Also, Emirates should grant its aircraft a 2-hour turn-around time slot. This would give 1 hour to clean and prep the aircraft for boarding and an additional hour to complete boarding, ensuring an on-time departure.",9,8th July 2019,Kuwait
525,"Not Verified |  I was travelling from  Gatwick to Kochi via Dubai and had a small carry on bag and my back pack. I was allowed 7 Kgs and my bag weighed a little over 7 Kgs. I did not have any problem at  Gatwick Airport. I had a connecting flight from Dubai to Kochi. As  Dubai airport duty free had some excellent deals and I ended up buying a couple of bottles of liquor and some chocolates. At the boarding gate, the customer service personnel forced me to weigh my carry on bags again and found 4 Kgs extra due to the items that I bought from the airport and asked me to pay for over weight. I was given 3 options: 1. Throw away the items that I bought from the airport (worth USD$200) 2. Return the items back to the store that was 20 minutes away from the gate 3. Pay for the excess baggage $100 I was put in a very tough situation when I was so tired from my previous two flights (8 hours each). I did not have any other choice than paying for the excess baggage. My advise to anyone travelling through Dubai, is to avoid buying any thing from the duty free if you already have 7 Kgs of items in your carry on baggage. They are going to weigh it at the boarding gate and charge you a huge amount that would kill all the savings that you got from your purchases. I will be happy if at least one person is benefited from this feedback. ",2,5th July 2019,Canada
526,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Manchester. The worst cabin service I have experienced on any airline. At great expense I took the flight from Dubai to Manchester yesterday, excited to be trying a business class seat on the A380. I fly often but I have to say this was the worst cabin crew I have ever experienced on any airline. I feel as if I paid for them to have a great holiday. I know that other passengers felt the same way. We were all SO upset that we talked to each other about it both on the plane and afterwards. From the moment of boarding, there was no usual warm welcome. I was greeted by a very grumpy hostile cabin attendant. When she brought the breakfast menu later she couldn’t answer simple questions about the ingredients. “I can’t say”. “Could you please find out?” “No, the meal is precooked, we can’t tell”. I have never had that response before. The crew stood and sat at the back chatting away having a great time. There were many of them and few passengers. A perfect opportunity to showcase individual, fantastic service. Unfortunately, the head of the cabin crew was at the back chatting with them all – so there was little leadership. After complaints from passengers, nothing changed. On take-off they did not remove our glasses, on landing they did not check that we were strapped in, they did not remove our cups and glasses once again. I choked on my breakfast and tried to call for help. I waved and pressed the service button. No one came. I managed to scramble out of my seat, balance my tray on the side and get to the bathroom where I vomited. The food was appalling, dry and over cooked. My tea was served cold. The attendant was so grumpy, rude and unhelpful that I actually asked her whether she’d had bad news from home. She said “I am tired!” I paid thousands of very hard-earned money for this flight – it is not the passengers’ job to do the work of the tired, disgruntled crew! They kept one toilet locked. They did not walk through the cabin to see if the passengers were ok. They did not help the mother with her 3 year old across the aisle from me. Airlines need to understand – we passengers no longer want glamour, lipstick, tight skirts and high heels – we want professional, great service from intelligent crew - happy to be in their highly sought-after jobs!",6,4th July 2019,Australia

I paid an absolute fortune for my ticket home and was very disappointed with the whole experience. Emirates made their partner airline who I flew first with, FlyDubai (who are very poorly rated/reviewed) look like a premium airline. I could go on and list all the bad things but the most important thing you need to know is that they gave me a severe bout of food poisoning!! It was a 13 hour flight and food poisoning symptoms occur in a very specific time window, so it HAD to be something I ate on the flight. Completely unacceptable.

528,"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. Despite recent reports about the extent to which Emirates’ quality of service has declined, I was impressed with every aspect of these two A380 flights. The limo pickup was on time with a friendly and helpful driver and there was only a short walk to business checkin. The Emirates lounge at Birmingham airport is spacious and well stocked and was only an equally short walk to the gate. Boarding was prompt and I will shown to my seat. There was a good choice of food and it was well served. My only criticism would have been the delay in bringing a glass of wine, forgetting my post-flight drink and having to ask to top it up. Apart from that the food was delicious and in a reasonable portions. The first A380 had the new design for the bar and there was a friendly group of passengers. The transfer at Dubai was quick and painless although allowing both economy and business passengers to exit through the same time did add some delay to exiting the aircraft. The flight to Bangkok was overnight and I chose to sleep. With the mattress, the seat was comfortable and I managed to sleep for a good three hours before being awoken for breakfast. The Wi-Fi connection on the plane was surprisingly stable and fast and there were enough movies to keep me entertained. Having flown on Emirates on a number of occasions in the past, I was relieved that although other accounts may be accurate, I found these two flights to high standard with nothing significant to complain about. The cabin crew were chatty and friendly and always keen to help answer any questions or respond to requests.",10,2nd July 2019,United Kingdom
529,"✅ Trip Verified | After a pleasant stay in the lounge at Dubai airport, it is a nice start to the long flight being able to board directly onto the upper deck without having to go down to the main terminal level so even though they may be boarding 80 passengers it always feels a little more civilized. It is a long but pleasant flight on the great A380, plenty of room and storage with the window seats on the upper deck. Another great crew and service and again the onboard bar is a big hit and the staff who take turns at the bar always seem friendly. Two full meals are served on this long flight a lunch and breakfast with a light snack in between with a good variety of snacks available at the bar.

During the boarding they did not call priority boarding for elderly, disabled passengers and passengers travelling with babies. Cabin crews were equally as rude and dismissive.

When I asked a flight attendant about the delay, she kept laughing and saying ""It's fine. No problem."" I believe a polite apology has to be issued.

I tried my special meal (acknowledge!) and all the other three menu dishes announced. All were absolutely substandard and not edible and I am not difficult and usually eat the dogs leftovers. But this was horrible and hazardous. Food in economy was edible and better than business. There was a cheese plate that helped me to avoid to starve. No ice creams and no inspirational additionals. Rate 6/10 Dubai-Bangkok was a great experience - as good as it gets on an airplane. A380 must be the king of the skies. Likely of my best flight ever, despite I had not slept the night before. I doubt that a general 1st class experience can beat this luxurious bz-class experience by Emirates on the A380. Simply outstanding on seat “hut”, meals, drinks. The onboard Sky Bar is a solid social effort and gimmick that is impressive and hard to dislike. I like the outer seats in the 1-2-1 biz-configuration with lots of space and great window access. The sports car design works well for me and the WiFi is solid and a bonus. Special meal was sophisticated and made to perfection. Rate 10/10 Lounge provided in Addis is the Ethiopian Cloud Nine Lounge which is slightly better than their Gold lounge.

Flight was full, service was poor, catering below average and service disjointed. Main course went cold waiting for wine and dessert was inedible, gave feedback to cabin crew who tried to blame (a) catering in Bangkok isn’t as good as Dubai and (b) they were one crew member down due to illness. Frankly I don’t care, if catering is subpar out out Bangkok then are ticket prices reduced because of it - no, so don’t blame the catering, own the issue.

540,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Venice via Dubai. As a regular of Qatar and Etihad on the Singapore-Europe route, this was my first time with Emirates. I would not call it a total disappointment, but the company is definitely (and sadly) not worth its fame. Positive aspects: new aircrafts, comfortable Economy seats with decent pitch, nice food (plus points for the metal cutlery), efficient ground staff. Seat selection is not complimentary and the cost disproportionate: the cheapest option for each of the 4 legs of my journey would have increased the ticket price by around 17%! Cabin service is close to no-frill airlines: no hot towel, no amenity kit, no staff walking around the aisle with trays of drinks during sleeping hours. The inflight entertainment on the A380 was a quite unresponsive touch screen with cursor. Charging plugs are only available to window and central seat. Worse part: the staff. I was told that an increasing number of Europeans had joined Emirates from Ryanair and I was displeased to see the same attitude brought to the 4-star airline. Apart from the lack of smiles and rough replies to some passengers that I could hear, the staff onboard the SIN-DXB night flight had been talking and laughing loudly in the galley for at least one hour after the light were switched off, going in and out without caring to seal the courtains. I have not seen such behaviour even on cheap low-cost carriers like Scoot or AirAsia, where the staff at least excercises the basic courtesy of letting their passengers sleep.

After numerous calls with Driver, Call Center of Emirates nobody showed up to pick me up even after 13.45pm. After wasting and waiting for almost 50 minutes in hot sun, I finally took a Taxi and paid to reach business arrivals terminal and neither luggage concierge nor staff bothered to help me with my luggage from taxi nor to push the trolley. I met duty manager and explained whole story and all he said was it’s okay we apologize but now please board the flight as you are late. Such a horrible customer service I never expected from Emirates, especially when traveling in business class. On-Board Experience: It’s Ramadan (fasting month for Muslims) month and I was fasting. Cabin crew informed me if am fasting then food will be served when it’s time to break my fasting but I should order the food in advance so that I get served. When it was time of breaking my fasting I asked for the food that was ordered in advance and very surprisingly crew told sorry we can’t serve the food and you need to adjust with a small sandwich box as we are planning to land. When I questioned crew why did they promised me to order food in advance and how can they deny serving the food for a fasting person then crew simply said it’s our policy and we can’t help. When I became furious then they simply gave me a quick main course to eat but I felt their frustration while getting served. I wasn’t served the food which I had preordered despite crew having enough time (around one hour was left to land the flight). Most of the passengers sitting around me enjoyed full meal (all items of menu) but I had to go through this bad experience because I was fasting. Crew argued a lot with me to explain that full meal will be served only during initial serving time and not later even if someone is fasting. I finally gave up arguing with the crew as I felt really embarrassed to ask for food again and again. ",6,5th June 2019,United Arab Emirates

All hand carry was measured and weighed also for business class passengers. This is the first time on over 200 long haul business class flights I have ever experienced this. Reason: Business class is full of economy class passengers being upgraded. B777 is a wide body wide aircraft with 2 entrances. All economy passengers seated on the 2 aisle are boarded through the front door and has to pass through business class to get to their seat. As a business class passenger this means a lot of noise and commotion, no service until boarding is complete and being hit several times by carry on luggage. No service/bad service continued through out the flight with no drinks being offered during meals and no attention to passengers at all.

On Sunday, 19th of May, my partner received information that there were shcedule changes in the itinerary. We called immediately as they rescheduled our flight for 13rd of May (day earlier that we booked originally). Additionally, instead of 1,5 hrs. of transfer they changed for 13hrs at Dubai Airport. They informed us that they cannot do anything about it because our flight has been cancelled. We said we cannot fly on 23rd due to our duties etc. and they said they all come back in the morning and asked us to call.

Not having a choice, we decided to take this flight having in mind that we need to be in Delhi on Sunday. We reached Dubai on 24th of May and we saw that the flight from Dubai to New Delhi has not been cancelled and departure was ongoing what means that they lie to us saying that the flight was cancelled. Once we noticed, we run to the reservation desk, was huge line but finally we asked if we can change the flight for 21:25 as originally planned. They said no, we cannot it is already overbooked, and boarding is closed. She said there is an option at 3 am as well but it is also overbooked, 30 people on the list so she all not adds to the waiting list even.

547,Not Verified |  New York to Trivandrum via Dubai. Flight was delayed by 3hrs and the cabin crew was unfriendly. I travelled with a 3yr old and they never offered any kids friendly items in flight. We ordered Vegetarian and Hindu veg meals. Vegetarian was a little better than Hindu veg meals but wouldn’t say good. Flight attendants did not respond to assistance call button from seat. Before the flight started for landing they started collecting the blankets and ear phones back.,4,30th May 2019,United States
548,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to New York JFK. We couldn’t afford buying a Business ticket since it was way too expensive so we started using AMEX credit card to get as many miles as possible and use them for the upgrade. Finally after a few months spending money and taking advantage of different promotions we collected more than half of the miles, the rest we bought them through emirates website (very expensive!). First problem started a week before our trip when we tried to reserve the chauffeur Emirates offer for Business class passengers, apparently they remove it from miles upgraded tickets a week before we made the upgrade (they didn’t say it unless you try to actually use it and they tell you that you can’t due to the type of ticket). Emirates has a direct flight from Dubai to FLL but upgrade tickets where not available when we bought them so we decided to go through JFK with our upgrade ticket, since we were coming from Bangkok we arrived at Dubai airport at midnight and our flight to JFK departed 8:15am (8hours stopover), during our honeymoon I checked the Dubai-FLL flight multiple times until we saw tickets available for upgrade, so we called Emirates to change it (this change would make us arrive at FLL 12 hours earlier since the stop over in Dubai was only 2 hours and we didn’t have to stop in JFK for another 3 hours and take an extra flight) the guy in the phone told us that through the phone he couldn’t guarantee that we would get business seats in the new flight since he had to revert the upgrade, transfer the economy ticket and request the upgrade again, but he recommended us to do it at the airport, if they had seats available they would be able to do it without a problem. When we got to Bangkok airport I checked online once again and the seats where still available so we spoke with the Senior Lounge Agent, she was extremely unhelpful and harsh with us, first I tried to explain the situation nicely but she didn’t care, and her response was “I’m sorry but in order to change we have to revert back the upgrade and the miles take 24-48 hours to be back in your account so you wont be able to upgrade for this flight”. It is disappointing because the guy over the phone told us exactly the opposite (wait until you get to the airport) and second because you are flying in business paying a lot of money (or a lot of miles) but they don’t seem to care, also since you have an upgrade ticket is for them as if you still have your economy ticket the attention is really bad. I regret a lot flying with Emirates, during our honeymoon we flew business with Qatar & Cathay and they were better, you cannot compare.",9,30th May 2019,Panama
549,✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Trip was relatively nice. Checked in around 11:PM at Suvarnabhumi International airport located the Emirates counter all the way at the back. What I found a bit strange that they were still about 4 or 5 people ahead of us in the business class counter and the first class counter was completely empty. Once checked in we (finally) didn’t have to go to the payment counter for overweight luggage since we had around 40KG baggage allowance. Got fast track passes so the security and immigration was a breeze.Once customs was over we headed to the lounge and had some water and tea. (Didn’t eat much not gonna lie) then we checked the Duty free a bit and headed to the gate. We got priority boarding so we didn’t have to wait that much. We entered the aero bridge and were welcomed by the cabin crew and located our assigned seats. Legroom was very decent the recline seating options were amazing for me and the flat bed was really easy and effective. IFE was amazing and the screen was fairly large.The headphones worked well and so did the tray table functions. What I found very useful was the storage space beside my seat. It even had its own minibar with Evian and Perrier and something else (not gonna lie I don’t remember). The food was ok p(not the best) and so was the onboard lounge and restrooms. Slept for about a hour since the flight is pretty short. And arrived at Hong Kong International Airport. Took the airport train and headed to immigration.Unfortunately there wasn’t any fast track immigration for premium passengers on arrival like in BKK. Luggage came pretty early and all in all a decent trip.,7,29th May 2019,Thailand
550,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Dubai. 1st leg: fr Sofia to Istanbul by Turkish Airlines (Apr 26:16-17:15) 2nd leg: fr Istanbul to Dubai (Apr 26: 19:25- Apr 27: 1pm) 3rd leg: fr Dubai to HK First, when I checked in online, the system said since the first leg was operated by Turkish, I could not do so. When I checked in in Sofia, Turkish  said I needed to get my other boarding passes from Emirates in Istanbul. The arrival time from Sofia to Istanbul was delayed by 15 mins & it took about 15 mins for the plane to drive to the parking terminal. Since my seat was at the end of the plane, it took another 15 mins for me to leave the plane. Then I ran around to find the transfer desk of Emirates. But I couldn't find any sign in the airport indicating where it was & the airport is very large. I asked many airport staff but they either did not know it or pointed me in the wrong direction. Finally I could find one airport staff member pointed me to the right location. When I arrived at the transfer desk, it was about 18:28 & the Celebi staff representing Emirates was not there & someone went inside the office behind to get him out. After he was out & checked the system, he said the checkin was closed.  He called his supervisor to see if they could let me check in. The answer was NO & he could not do anything else. I was angry because there was still about an hour before takeoff. He then said since my previous plane was delayed for 15 mins, Turkish should bear the responsibility. I then approached Turkish Airlines and asked 2 different staff members, they said 15 mins was just a short time & there was still about an hour before the next plane took off. Then there came the deadlock. I looked like an idiot running between the 2 airlines. They all treated me in bad attitude at the end, thinking I was a trouble maker. So the only thing I could do then was to book another air ticket. It costed me HK$4259.08 & 30 hours more. To me, I cannot understand why I couldn't check in when there was still about an hour before takeoff. I've just called Emirates' customer service, they said I must check in 1 hour before takeoff. The experience is the worst I ever have.",8,25th May 2019,Hong Kong
551,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Brussels via Dubai. I've flown them roughly every three years or so for the last two decades and they seem as good as ever. They're not perfect, and some other carriers have done a good job of catching up (particularly in economy class) but Emirates is still one of the better choices. The check in team and gate agents are efficient and patient. I had a problem with my mobile boarding pass not scanning and they were able to print me a new paper one with a smile. The aircraft was an older 777, but still mostly functional--there was a problem with the seat recline on my second segment. The entertainment system is good, but trying to cater to every culture they serve means the pool of options for English is pretty shallow. I was able to keep myself entertained, but just barely. Comedy is a weak spot for sure. The two hours of free wifi is good, but the connection is pretty poor. Emirates food is decent, though one flight only had an option of lamb or cod. Those are both rather specific tastes, I'd have been happier if they had gone with at least one safer choice of beef, chicken, or pasta. But the food was good and the desserts definitely stand out. Emirates doesn't stack up to the Asian carriers in terms of frequently circulating with water between meals, but the crew seemed service focused enough that you would get some if you asked. Connecting in Dubai is not a great experience. It's not as horrible as Doha but there is an amazing lack of plumbing in the airport, ensuring long lines at the toilets. Add to that some really extensive walks to get from gate to gate, and I'd be wary of advising any mobility impaired friends to try this without assistance. The flights were close to on time, but both arrived a little bit late without any logical explanation--no headwinds, ATC delays, or other obvious issues. Despite all those little negatives, Emirates is still a top notch experience.",4,22nd May 2019,Thailand
552,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newcastle to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai . I have flown with Emirates on and off for years, and you can really see cost cutting and staff attitudes changing, on my flights anyway. Their bar service is non existent more or less, you get offered a drink with your meal, and thats about it, if you want a drink of anything you have to keep ring for service, which most folk like myself dont like to do. No hot towels on getting on the craft, your just left, food has notably gone down in quality too! On the second leg of the flight, it was a 4.20am takeoff, we were left without so much as a drink of water for 3 hours, i had medication to take and asked them for water, , they must have a water shortage! It was brought in an eggcup size cup. Eventually got brought a substandard breakfast, which has been so chilled its lost all its flavour, no alcohol offered on this flight. The service has massively changed, you can really see it is like the staff cant be bothered, just wanna chuck the food at you, so they can rest and talk in the galley. I paid £700 for my flight and felt ripped off, it would put me off travelling with them again. However, it is very handy from Newcastle upon Tyne to get a bit further afield, come on Emirates, get your act together! One positive is the IFE, very good.",3,19th May 2019,United Kingdom
553,"✅ Trip Verified |  Prague to Bangkok via Dubai. I am very disappointed about the quality and service provided by the Emirates. It started at the check-in desk where I have checked 1 luggage and explicitly asked the staff member as I carry a lot of camera, lens, cables etc, if I can have drone (small size) with me in cabin bag. I was told yes, you don`t have to have it in checked baggage. Then at the security check right before the boarding gate I was told and forced to put drone into checked luggage, but I was not provided any bag for that and that I have to take care of it myself that it`s my mistake I was told by Emirates staff at the gate, BUT thanks to local security officers on airport (not emirates staff) They helped me to find bag, some papers and airbags to secure the drone. I said OK nice start, but then it continued with the service onboard. The menu was served after 2 hours after the take off and no walkaround of staff around. No water offer, only if you come by person to staff asking for water or something. The food was average - good taste, selection of 2 main food chicken vs beef and drinks. I asked for a beer and I was told they run out of beer. so I asked for Gin and Soda, and I was told, I dont have it with me but if you wait 10-15 minutes I will get it right back for you, and I waited approx 20 mins to get the gin and tonic. You can see attached picture of the snack we were offered, and I was like really, you can select small pretzels or kitkat?  I can only say that the seat comfort (176cm tall) and entertainment - big screen was the only positive about the flight. ",2,16th May 2019,Czech Republic
554,"✅ Trip Verified |  Me and a toddler flew from Dubai to Kochi. Initially opted for a wheelchair, but later got on the buggy to gate as child not allowed on wheelchair. We both have comfortably travelled in other airlines together in a wheelchair. The buggy management is not proper, had to wait in their holding area till the last moment to get to gate. Later had to rush thru the gate with rude staff. Had flown before, but their standard and staff are not up to the expectations any more.  They should improve their services to Indian routes who are paying the same money. Mostly double standards. As mentioned in other reviews food is basic.",4,16th May 2019,United Arab Emirates

Before even my parents landed Dubai, I got a text message saying 2nd leg flight rebooked for next day (24 hour delay) due to unforeseen circumstance. When I called customer service, I was told flight was cancelled due to operational issues which is a lie. I can see the status of the flight as landing on time on their website. The service provided during wait time is horrible. This is my last time travelling with Emirates!",8,16th May 2019,United States
556,"✅ Trip Verified |  Singapore to Brisbane. This is the first time we have flown this route with Emirates for a few years. The chauffeur was very friendly and polite even offering to stop/slow down for photos I was taking. The lounge was great, the food was very good as is usual in the Emirates own lounges. The hot food was very good with a good choice of Asian dishes, and we especially loved the freshly made to order dumplings. The only let down was that they served Moet and not Veuve Cliquot which was what was previously on offer. On board the cabin layout of 3-2-3 was disappointing and the seat comfort was not good. However the aircraft was very clean and well maintained. The service to start off was a bit hit and miss, although did improve after the meal service. Champagne on board again was only Moet. The promised drinks after takeoff was not delivered until we reminded them and also the wines we had already ordered with our meals did not eventuate until reminded a couple of times. The food was good but nothing exciting, with no dine on demand or pre ordering available which I think would be an improvement. No amenity kits, only socks and eyeshades provided.",1,15th May 2019,Australia
557,"✅ Trip Verified | First time for a long time with Emirates - normally I would use Etihad, and first time A380 business class. Overall, a curates's egg. However, you come to expect more from Emirates particularly given the cost of their flights. The good points: check in and bag delivery was excellent, as was the chauffeur service to / from DXB. The cabin appeared spotless, though all was not as it seemed. The crew were immaculate and charming if a little robotic. The quibbles: boarding at DXB was chaotic. It should not take nearly 2 hours to clear queuing passengers into the gate, the flight eventually leaving 90 minutes behind schedule. On the flight to CAN I was not welcomed onboard, or offered a drink, or a drink order taken on the return. If paying top dollar there is an expectation FAs keep tabs on their assigned passengers. However, the biggest disappointment was the food. I'd pre-ordered vegetarian. On the outward leg I was presented what I considered at the time to be the most uninspired slop I'd seen in nearly 50 years of flying, boiled mixed vegetables in a tasteless sauce on couscous. Until my return flight, that is. A 'dish' of boiled noodles with a squirt of neat tomato puree on top and accompanies by half a dozen near raw peas in their pods. The excellent sweet did not compensate. The FA apologized and offered any selection from the menu as an alternative. Trouble is, unlike other full fare airlines, including for economy class (Etihad), Emirates offers no vegetarian - or vegan - options. One assumes Emirates' management would rather vegetarians stay away. Henceforth I shall duly support this policy. I strongly recommend other vegetarians do likewise. Finally, I enjoy watching wildlife programmes as part of IFE. What I appreciate less is being 'entertained' through the night by the antics of a cockroach presumably making its way home through my seating area disappearing into the seat recess in front. Where there's one there'll be many more. Which rather sums up Emirates: a glossy veneer but rather grubby beneath.",9,12th May 2019,United Arab Emirates
558,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was very much looking forward to Emirates flight and had pre-set expectations of high standards of service and comfort. I was traveling with my Mother on the flight and I must say that the flight was pretty average nowhere close to Emirates brand of service. A couple of gripes on their Boeing 777 from Mumbai - Dubai - flown 07 March 2019. Inattentive cabin crew - No response to hostess call bell multiple times, had to verbally call out for assistance.  No water provided on boarding the aircraft and you had to ask for water and that also was cheaply been distributed in open plastic glasses the way they do it by the road side in India pouring out of packaged drinking water bottles. For more than an hour no water or snacks were offered and the food that was served was average and that was it, no munchies or a bottle of water before the dinner was served. Getting a glass of juice was a challenge and everything was being served very stingily. 5The flight seats are of very poor width since the flight is crammed with lot many seats per row, the food tray could barely fit on it. Uncomfortable aisles and poor comfort overall. The positive -  The inflight entertainment and camera view, that was the only saving grace.  Comparatively new flight and clean upholstery. Conclusion - For me Emirates was as average as any other full service airlines in India. Not too happy about the overrated hype regarding brand Emirates especially on Indian routes.",5,12th May 2019,India
559,"✅ Trip Verified | What happened on EK-001 on 9th May 2019? I've flown Emirates many times with excellent service, but this flight was disgusting. I get a special meal, gluten free, so my food arrived 30 mins before the general rush, then the normal food distribution. The food trays were then left (on people's laps) for maybe '4 hours'. This made it awkward to get up as one had to ask a neighbour to hold your tray plus their tray to go the toilet. I plan my in-flight experience down to exactly which seat and which meal, to minimise inconvenience, but this didn't work on EK-001 (09/05/19). Drinks trolleys were abandoned opposite toilets making for less space to stand. The flight standard was all the worse because I had just got off the excellent flight from Perth, Australia, arriving at gate A1 departing gate A3. It was such a shock coming from a serene feeling on a flight inbound to their Dubai hub, and the excellent experience in their hub, plus the great flights out to Australia. It genuinely felt as if the stewards were on strike. (This was the flight where we were told at the end, suitcases in hand, packed in the aisles, to return to our allocated seats because the British police were coming on board.). Come on, Emirates! You blew it here.",2,12th May 2019,United Kingdom
560,"✅ Trip Verified |  After 1 month in Thailand and the prospect of coming home to rainy Scotland, I decided to treat myself and upgrade my original economy ticket to business class. Okay I'll get all the positives out the way first. Great lounge at BKK, fully stocked with drinks and all the food I had was very tasty and prepared to a high standard. Seat and all the amenities that come with it were spot on, this is for the A380. The B777 is a more cramped affair altogether, so if you can, fly on the A380 - this applies to economy as well. I loved relaxing at the A380 bar area, watching the football on the big screen, whilst enjoying a freshly made cocktail, bliss! Now the negative, yes, just one, but it's a biggie and that would be the service. Now, don't get me wrong, there were some very pleasant FA's, albeit a bit false but as for the others it's the reason I won't fly Emirates again. After dinner I had a full glass of champagne in front of me, the FA tried to snatch it away, I don't understand this and why would you not ask the customer if they are finished? Needless to say, I snatched it back, much to the FA's annoyance, forgive me for wanting to finish my drink when I'm paying good money. Another point is the staff just hanging around the bar towards the end of the flight, as thought it was their own staff room, I wanted to just chill and spend the last couple hours of my flight reading my book but this just totally put me off. I work in hospitality myself and believe those areas are for the customer and the customer only not for staff to drape themselves over. Upon arrival at the lounge in Dubai, I gave my ticket to receptionist and as I was off a flight and a bit tired I made the heinous mistake of going the wrong way ""Where are you going sir"" was said to me in the tone of ""what are doing you complete and utter buffoon"", not pleasant in the slightest, such a sour character and one you wonder why bother working with the public? So in a nutshell, great food, IFE, seats etc etc. But very, average service, bordering on downright rude at times. For this reason I'll be trying Singapore in future and avoiding Emirates entirely. It's a bad day when a low cost carrier like Easyjet are miles ahead of you in the service department.",4,10th May 2019,United Kingdom
561,"Not Verified |  We travelled Emirates yet again because we are moving back to England. This one-way flight was a pleasant one. The airport wasn't a pigsty like it usually is when we travel in the summertime. The cabin staff and ground staff are very friendly. When we were at the airport, however, we had to pay AED120 for baggage wrapping only because they didn't have plastic, which isn't very fair, but anyhow. Boarding gate was pretty busy and it was a full flight. It was fairly pleasant on board - no screaming babies for the majority of the duration of flight but just when we took off there was one family with a crying baby. ICE is great but children's selection of films is lousy. Good music on the flight - almost every song i wanted to listen to E-section (Entertainment) had. Seats aren't the most comfortable seats in the world. Food and beverage is great, and almost beats Singapore Airlines' meals.

563,"✅ Trip Verified |  I flew out LHR-DXB on economy and was upgraded to business for the return flight. Economy was not too busy so had middle seat free. Check-in was fine and meal quality for economy was pretty good. ICE had a big choice. Flight left a bit late but caught up. 30 minute wait to get my bag at DXB. Return flight - check-in took forever, not enough attendants but getting upgraded to business certainly made up for it. I travelled business on Emirates about 4 years ago and seat configuration has improved and having access to the stand-up bar was great. if I had been paying for business I would have been a bit miffed that my first choice of steak had already gone by the time I was asked. My first course of arabic mezze was served with a choice of breads but no arabic wraps/breads which would have been a far better accompaniment.Main course of seafood biriani was prawns hidden in a flavoured rice, pleasant but nothing remarkable and a bit dry. Pudding of Mango millefeuille was excellent. Choice of wines was fine.

564,✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Johannesburg. Absolute horrific customer service. As I approved I informed the lady I’m flying to Johannesburg and the count will close soon. (20 minutes) she said it’s fine I need to wait in the queue. of about 19/20 counters there was one person working. There was about 9 passengers in front of me. I waited as told. When I reached the counter finally the lady told me I missed my check in (by 5 minutes) as I was waiting. She refused to help or assist and told me I need to speak to another counter. The manager that he is just said I need to rebook and it’s not his problem. As I booked my flight through a third party (my fault) and was checked in already I lost both my flights as I was a no show. This cost me AED 4500 roughly. Emirates has really lost its wow factor with ground staff attitudes. Might as well be all automatic as they will be more pleasant. Most horrible and very expensive experience.

After we alight the flight (EK773) in Dubai airport at the remote bay, I immediately recalled that I left 3 bottles of liquor on the aircraft during the bus ride to the terminal. It was about 00:30L 28 Apr 2019. Once we arrived at the terminal, we sought help from an Emirates staff, he asked me to go to the information desk. Then we sought the information desk to help, the information desk staff refer me to the transit connection counter. Then we went to connection counter to ask for help. The connection counter staff asked us to wait for one hour there, she said she would see if anyone retrieved anything from the aircraft. Please note that at this point, no staff took note of any of our PAX information. I waited for an hour and went back to the connection counter. The encounter staff dialled Lost & Found and simply passed me the phone to me. The Lost & Found said the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has retrieved from the aircraft. Since it was about the boarding time for our next flight, I asked my wife to head to the boarding gate and ask the gate staff to help and I waited for 15 mins more. Once my wife arrived at the gate and asked for help. Again, the gate staff simply passed the phone to my wife and asked her to talk to Lost & Found. At this time, the Lost & Found lady told my wife the aircraft has been cleared and nothing has been retrieved. I arrived at the gate 15 mins later. I was so angry because no ground staff were trying to help and none of them seemed care at all. Their service attitude was terrible! The gate staff explained that maybe other PAX took them. I claimed that we were the last PAX to alight the aircraft since we knew we have 3 hrs for transit therefore we didn't need to rush. At this point, we gave up and entered the waiting area at Gate A8. 15 mins later, I decided to ask the gate staff to call the Lost & Found again and let me talk to the Lost & Found directly. This time, the Lost & Found staff told me the aircraft has not been cleared, nothing has been retrieved yet. What is going on? I told her no one recorded any of my PAX information. Then she asked me to send an e-mail to [email protected] as it is the standard procedure for Emirates. I sent the e-mail right away and they acknowledged my query. 24 hours has passed and I still hear nothing! This was my first time flying with Emirates and it was terrible!

My recent flight with Emirates was great overall. But yes, their services went down (seat selection no longer free, 25kg only for Economy Class, no more hot towels served prior to departure in Economy Class. Other negatives are: WiFi was available but not working on both flights. IFE Box under the seats blocking some legroom. Very tiring boarding organization unlike Qatar Airways, Emirates closes the gate 45 minutes prior to departure time, while Qatar Airways closes the gate 20 minutes prior to departure time. Emirates’s 45 minutes causes a long long queue. Postives, good and comfortable seats, the 10-abreast B777-300ER is decent, not as bad as people say. Of course I won’t deny the Award-Winning Excellent ICE Entertainment System. Despite both flights were operated on old planes with very unresponsive touch screens, the movies selection were up-to-date. Very friendly cabin crew, excellent meal service for a 1 hour 30 minutes flight. Clean cabin, beautiful and luxury Orange-Colored-mood-lighting system.

Once on board the flight attendants were very helpful and friendly. They attached the baby cot to the divider, my 2 older children, 6 & 3, saw the baby pack and wanted the blankets as they came with penguins (didn’t say anything, they just poured!) and they were more than happy to supply these for them. The children’s food was a good selection of food they actually ate, we were checked on regularly and we found the flight more relaxing than we’d expected travelling with 3 small children!

Flight EK19 back to Manchester on 24th April 2019 not so good. Family to our right let their 3 or 4 year old daughter play in the aisle for approx 5 of the 7 hours flight, she was jumping up and down banging on the floor, swinging on seats, hit my son and staff never said a word at any point even though she was constantly in their way/playing next to other passengers further down the plane, even when they were eating. The father was sat on the aisle seat but made not 1 single attempt to control his daughter, he looked like everything was an effort (except eating the extra meals he asked for, and got) and instead put his headphones on/snoozed whilst his daughter roamed about (in between asking staff for things out of sequence instead of waiting to be served like the rest of us). Was disappointed with the lack of staff response, it ruined our flight. The man had an air of entitlement for some reason, even though his family had 3 seats so, in a way, us families next to him with 4 seats had paid more to be there yet got a worse service (I know it doesn't work like that but it is annoying when 1 passenger thinks they are above everyone else). To make it worse a man had been moved from his rightful seat to accommodate the family in those seats (they had missed their earlier flight so were put on this one instead), which was annoying in hindsight - we would all have had a nice flight in zone D if the original man seated there had not been forced to move. I also paid for extra wifi on both journeys and then it didn't work! Waste of £20! My Emirates experience was 10/10 on the way there and then reduced to 4/10 on the way back.",1,25th April 2019,United Kingdom

Emirates crew noticed us as platinum members and were helpful, we received every necessary information about the routes too.

However I can't happen to notice the severe decline of the service quality. Grumpy staff, poor quality juices, no amenity kit for over 8h flights.

Even if not the cheapest choice on this route note that flying the A380 worth the premium price because of the superb comfort and silence of the aircraft.

I haven't travelled with Emirates since 2012, and back then it was fantastic.

Now BA offers much better service on long haul flights than Emirates.",9,21st April 2019,United Kingdom
576,✅ Trip Verified | Singapore to Edinburgh via Dubai. Was quite excited for this route but turns out to be a total nightmare and I would much rather stuck with my usual BA. The second leg of the flight from Dubai was delayed by 45 min. Plane was hot for the morning flight and cabin crew was rarely in sight for the entire 8 hours. Rarely had water or beverages offered. It felt like a budget flight. On the return flight ground staff had poor customer service. I wanted to buy an extra bag at the airport but they insisted on charging me overweight which amounted to £500 and resulting me in leaving my belongings in the UK. Inflight service was poor. Again cabin crew are rarely in sight. The second leg the snack was so dry I spat it out. Also not to mention no cabin crew was bringing out water for the flight. Overall an incredible letdown. Never flying this route again and Emirates isn’t worth the hype.,9,19th April 2019,Singapore
577,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Manila via Dubai. Was recommended by a colleague to fly Emirates business class. What I was surprised about was I experienced 2 very different business class products – I was totally shocked at the difference. London to Dubai was on an Airbus and Dubai to Manila a Boeing 777. The Airbus flight was aligned to business class travel expectations, seat was reasonably comfortable, large selection of IFE, food was of a good quality. My only quibbles were the seat belt length seemed quite short – it was tight on me and not something I experienced on other airlines; staff helped when asked but otherwise didn’t offer. The Boeing product is significantly inferior – uncomfortable seating and it was not lie flat, no storage at all, 2-3-2 configuration, no amenity kit etc, slow food service with a very limited selection. The Boeing flight is like flying premium economy – a good amount of leg room and a wider seat (seat belt size was much longer) but that’s as much as I can positively say about it. It was a really uncomfortable flight for me given it was close to 9 hours – I felt cheated for having paid for a business class seat. Regrettably, I had 2 more business class flights that week with Emirates which were not refundable otherwise I would have cancelled. Flew HKG to Dubai on an Boeing 777 - just as bad (if not worse) than the Manila flight. What storage existed was used by the cabin staff, myself and 2 other passengers had to store our cabin bags several rows behind us in a single overhead – we had to do this ourselves, no help or interest from cabin staff. Food was awful. Lounge in Dubai served excellent food and beverages and had some nice quiet seating areas. However, if you wanted some F&B getting it was a bit of a challenge - I witnessed only 2 serving stations for main courses and tea/coffee - despite being there for over an hour, never did manage to be able to get through the endless throng to get a cup of tea. I regularly travel long haul for business but I'm afraid Emirates does not get a recommendation from me.",7,18th April 2019,United Kingdom
578,"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought an economy ticket to Cairo but the service was very poor, is totally different what you see on publicity and advertising spots. The cabin crew were not professional.

The free wifi, was not working for the way DXB to CAI so I was so disappointed really. ",10,17th April 2019,United Arab Emirates
579,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Dubai. I always thought Emirates was supposed to be one of the best but let me tell you, it is not. The staff were pretty professional but that is common among airlines. I was initially excited to be flying in an A380 for the first time but the moment I boarded, my heart sunk. It was obvious Emirates had chosen the the cheapest possible configuration that you would expect on a budget domestic airline. The seats were super low quality and grubby. There was next to no padding which made it painful for a 14 hour flight. The air was dry, but worse is the LED lighting which has a low Hz flicker. This becomes migraine inducing as the lighting splits into green blue and red as you move your eyes about. There is also an insufficient number of toilets available. The Boeing 787 is much better from my experiences on other airlines. Overall disappointed.",4,14th April 2019,Australia

In-flight Wi-Fi was affordable - $20 for unlimited wi-fi.",9,12th April 2019,Australia
581,"✅ Trip Verified | Probably the worst flight I ever had with EK since I started flying with them 13 years ago. My route was DXB-CAI and return both ways were with very old outdated B777. First of all EK stopped handing hot towels prior to take off, inflight magazines are removed from the seat pocket probably to reduce cost. On the way DXB-CAI we boarded on time however there was a delay of 1 full hour sitting on board with no explanation. Crew didn’t even bother to serve water or a juice and no explanation from the captain, secondly my headphones were not working properly due to the age of the aircraft and I had to keep holding it. Seat was broken and always reclining however I informed the crew but nothing happened, they kept asking me to adjust my seat to up position and I kept telling them it was broken. On the way back it was the opposite, it wouldn’t recline at all. The food service also has dropped a lot with the quality of the meal service and the portions which have become similar to what you get on a Low cost. When arrived back to Dubai also 30 mins late the luggage was delayed for more than an hour, they announced on the speakers but no explanation which led to being late for my early morning meeting as was supposed to land at 7:10am and had meeting at 9:30 am but I had to cancel it and of course no explanation or visibility of EK staff. I’m seriously trying to avoid using them as much as possible now. Very disappointed with what they have became.",2,10th April 2019,United Arab Emirates
582,"✅ Trip Verified |  Houston to Dubai. We have so much high opinion about Emirates since we had flown 3 years back. But looks like new Emirates is about boasting and less action. Right from the time we checked in to inflight cabin crew to nightmare of changing the flights, it has been a nightmare. When i send a feedback to Emirates, no reply back from them. The cabin crew has no regards to the passenger and they would not even react to the call unless you personally go to their area and ask for water. The customer service was a nightmare. Based on where you call, you get that type of service.  If there are other options, i would avoid flying Emirates. ",2,10th April 2019,United States
583,"Not Verified | Newark to Delhi via Dubai. Prior to flying with Emirates, I flew with all the American and major European airlines in North America, and Europe. I must say Emirates is way better than all, and exceeded my expectation. Seating quality, leg space, TV screen, selection of movies and tv shows, food all are fantastic. As of now, this is the best airline so far. This was the fifth time I was flying with this airline, and I will continue with them. Also, connecting in Dubai airport is easy. Security screening is very fast and convenient. The airport itself is amazing, so if you're flying with Emirates and transiting here in Dubai, you're in great hands!",6,10th April 2019,United States
584,"✅ Trip Verified | Flight EK191 on 19th March had aircraft change from 777-300 to 777-200. We always reserve (at extra cost) dual seats of row 48 but were re-allocated to seats row 37 which on the seat map look identical. However, on boarding we found that 3 extra rows had added and row 37 was a normal triple seat. The purser apologised and moved us to the only double row available in row 39 - the one with fixed arm rests and of-set screens. My request for a refund of the seat reservation charge of €80 was refused on the grounds that Emirates are allowed to make changes for 'operational reasons'. Because of the extra rows seat pitch is now 31"" and not the 33"" - 34"" shown on the seat map. Food quality has also dropped but I overcame this by ordering a Kosher meal for this return flight which was delicious after waiting 20 minutes for it to thaw out!

Manchester to Dubai. Emirates is vastly overrated. Good inflight entertainment but that is it. Poor impersonal service that was surly, their cabin crew are far from the best. The whole experience lacked any character and as for the afternoon tea before landing - their version of a sandwich is a literally one quarter of what even the most diet conscious would expect. Fly Emirates to be treated like just a number. Not looking forward to return flight. Luggage took about an hour to arrive in Dubai.",4,9th April 2019,United Kingdom
586,"✅ Trip Verified | London Gatwick to Islamabad via Dubai. My first time on Emirates. I had heard good things about this airline in the past so decided to give it a go. Baggage drop-off at Gatwick was fine. The gate at Gatwick was horrible, a small space to accommodate all economy class passenger of an A380. Most of us had to stand for a long time before boarding commenced as the seating at the gate were totally inadequate. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but the IFE did not work. The seat would not recline either. The stewardess tried to help but ended up apologizing for the broken IFE and seat. The meal service was good and the quality of food reasonable, however, the portion sizes were very small. The flight from Dubai to Islamabad was not good at all. Boarding at Dubai was chaotic, Most passengers were not allowed to take their hand luggage on board with them as according the staff at the gate the flight was full and there would not be enough space on the plane for hand luggage despite the fact that most people had just one item of hand luggage with them. The boarding process took a long time and the gate staff didn't seem too bothered. The seats on Boeing 777-300ER were extremely uncomfortable, the legroom was very tight and the seat width was also very cramped. Shortly after boarding completed, the cabin lights were switched off with on the screens and seat belt signs providing any light. The captain announced that we would be delayed due to heavy traffic along our flight path. No cabin crew were around to answer any queries and any calls for them were ignored. We eventually left Dubai over an hour late. The rest of the flight was unremarkable. The crew were not very friendly and didn't seem too bothered. The breakfast was ok but again the portion size was very small. After landing the I noticed that most of the cabin crew seemed absent with only one stewardess standing by the door. She did not bother to smile or say goodbye to anyone.",10,9th April 2019,United Kingdom
587,"Not Verified |  Oslo to Singapore via Dubai. I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. My friends who have flown with them, told me that has very good food in economy class, and the cabin crew are friendly. This is the opposite of what I have experienced. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai on the 21st of March. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. Before the flight, I was happy that I could use the ICE, an internationally awarded In-flight entertainment system. I was really disappointed when I touched the screen, because it was unusable. The screen heated up to 40-50 degrees, and the touch didn't work well. The food was OK, but again, I expected something more from an airline like Emirates. Two members of the cabin crew were rude to me. The flight from Dubai to Singapore with A388 was really good. Plenty of legroom under the seat in front of me. Back to Oslo, I have ordered Vegetarian meal to try something different (I had Asian vegetarian meal from OSL to SIN). I was angry when they gave me vegan food. Is it so hard to see the difference between Vegetarian and vegan food?. It was definitely the worst meal I have eaten on an airplane. I recommend to choose an another airline if you have a possibility to do so. I could fly cheaper with Finnair or  Qatar airways, but i choose Emirates only because they had the A380. ",3,8th April 2019,Norway
588,"✅ Trip Verified | I expected something more from Emirates. I've heard many pros about the airline from my friends who have flown with Emirates and an ex-Emirates stewardess. What I experienced, is the opposite of what they told me. They told me that the food is the best food you can eat in economy class. I have also read that the ICE intertainment system is the best IFE system in the world. I do not agree at all. My first flight was from Oslo to Dubai, flight number EK 160. We flew with a Boeing 777, reg A6-EWC. I was excited to try the ICE, so the first thing I did after I found my seat was to try the system. I was very disappointed when I realized, that the screen's temperature is over 40 degrees, and the touch works badly. The sound from the headphones was also very noisy, I think that DACs in the aircraft were maybe broken. I ordered Asian Vegetarian meal (AVML) on their website before the flight. Agian, I expected something more from a 4 star airline like Emirates. The food was just OK, nothing more than that. The next flight was from Dubai to Singapore with an A380, reg A6-EOT. The A380 was the best long haul plane I have flown with. There was a lot of legroom, and place next to the seat (I had a window seat) to leave small things like a pillow or your headsets. This time, the ICE worked well, and was more advanced than the old crap in the 777. Unfortunately, the cabin crew were rude and they didn't care about the passengers as much as the cabin crew in KLM or even AirAsia. I saw them only when twice when they gave food to the pax. On the way back to Oslo, I ordered Vegetarian meal. I was shocked, when they came with a Vegan meal. Is it so hard to see the difference? All other airlines offer vegeterian food or even lacto-ovo vegetarian etc. Also, I don't recommend the meal for those who are Vegans. It was really disgusting, and it was too warm. I will never recommend this airline to anybody. I could fly cheaper with airlines like Qatar Airways, LOT or Finnair, but I bought an Emirates ticket just for the A80.",2,8th April 2019,Norway
589,"✅ Trip Verified |  Beirut to Colombo via Dubai. The flights were comfortable both ways and Emirates staff on board were helpful and friendly but on our way back from Colombo to Dubai we had a short layover and our first flight was delayed and then parked miles from the terminal, necessitating a long bus ride and meaning that we rushed to make our connection. When we arrived at our gate we enquired if our bags would make the connection and were told that they were in the process of being transferred. Our flights was then delayed by the gate for 30 minutes, leaving plenty of time for the bags to be loaded. Despite this, when we arrived in Beirut, we received a message to say our luggage wasn't on the plane and would arrive on the next flight, eight hours later. We were told by ground staff that it could not be delivered and we would have to return to the airport to collect it. It took us almost an hour to find the Emirates office and someone who would help us. He promised that if we returned that evening to collect the bags the office would be open and Emirates staff would help us and would reimburse our taxi costs. When we got back, the office was closed and locked and no one answered the phone. We tried going back three times over the course of an hour. No one was there. Eventually we got our bags but the process meant we lost almost four hours of our day and over $30 in additional taxi costs. Finally, as we were leaving the airport, Emirates staff called us to say that they were at baggage claim, though we had already been there to get our bags and seen no sign of them. When we explained that we had already left the airport, they told us to come back, despite the fact that we had already lost all the money on the extra taxis, not to mention our one free day back at home to prepare before going back to work.

593,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Dubai. First time flying Emirates business class and was excited to try it but very disappointed after my experience. No greeting by any of the staff even the check in staff. I got the middle seat and felt very claustrophobic. If you are also going as a couple or with a friend, it’s hard to carry a conversation with the person you are flying next to since the divider in between doesn’t even go down completely. On a long plane ride, this is very frustrating that you cannot even carry a proper conversation or see the person next to you. In terms of the service, the stewardess serving me was lazy and made me hand her all the trays and hand myself all the plates rather than setting it down directly on the table. I thought this is very unsafe since some dishes are very hot. She was also too lazy to make the bed for me so I had to do it myself. Not only that but one of the stewardesses left the tray on the seat in front of us which crashing down in front of my boyfriends feet during the middle of the flight. The head flight attendant walking by noticed it and didn’t even apologize and rather asked us abruptly what had happened like it was our fault his staff left the tray there. There are also no slippers or pajamas offered like other flights. The food is also not personalized and not very good. They didn’t even offer us dessert and when we asked for it, they assumed someone had already taken our order and didn’t give us the dessert. Most of all, the airport lounge in Dubai on the way to another city is really outdated, basic and unimpressive. It’s really long and big but composed of the same basic food drinks and no amenities other than a few shower rooms. The spa which was on the map was closed and half the loung was also closed when we were there for no reasons given. All the other major airlines business class I had taken including cathay, Singapore airlines, korean air and Etihad had much better lounges. I especially expected more since Emirates is Dubai’s flagship carrier but it looks like they cut costs severely. Would not take Emirates again although I already bought several more tickets for the rest of the leg of this trip that I cannot cancel. Some positives were chauffeur service, private entrance at gate for customs and security check in the Dubai airport, and the entertainment system on the plane which had a lot of movies. However the WiFi was very slow,  overall very disappointed.",4,25th March 2019,United States

595,"✅ Trip Verified | I and my husband are 71 years old, flying regularly twice a year for many years and this flight was our worst flying experience ever! This flight was 6 hours long and we purchased the tickets with Emirates based on their advertising and did not mind paying almost double price than all the other companies charge. We wanted on this pretty long flight more comfort, wider seats, more legroom, good food and overall better experience as Emirates advertise. The outbound flight was with Emirates partner company FLy Dubai, Boeing 737Max not Airbus 380 as they advertise. Nothing of the advertisement was true. The airplane had regular narrow seats and little legroom and there was no complimentary drinks and food at all. This is almost criminal! Yes, you could buy drinks and food but why you pay almost double price to fly with this company? Their advertisement is fraudulent. On this journey we also flew from Abu Dhabi to Muscat with Oman Air. The flight was only 60 min. long and complimentary drinks and luncheon was served. Than we flew from Muscat back to Dubai with Swiss Air. On this only 50 min. long flight complimentary water and snack was served. The inbound flight with Emirates was not bad, Airbus 380, little wider seats and little more legroom, complimentary drinks and food. Nothing really great but OK. I complained to Emirates about our outbound flight without any successful result. They wrote me that their partner company should have same standards and that they are looking forward to see me on board again. I felt offended! I would never fly with Emirates again.",6,21st March 2019,Canada

Oblivious to the passengers, I have never seen this in all my years of flying. In front of the loos and the bar area. Really poor show. The cabin crew seemed to be more interested in socialising with each other with a few noticeable exceptions, the Filipinos. Meal service efficient as opposed to caring, was told the WiFi wasn’t working but could see passengers using it, think the crew member couldn’t be bothered to help. Positives - excellent limousine pick up, lounges and connections. Entertainment first class. Don’t get complacent or arrogant Emirates as customers aren’t stupid.",1,20th March 2019,United Kingdom

My last flight from Dubai to London Heathrow, it was 3 hours and 10 minutes before I was offered a drink! The food was lukewarm on both legs, and had to be swapped over. Emirates seems to have cut costs terribly in recent years, it's economy service is miles behind even budget carriers now.

Cabin service was good but ground service was terrible especially in Gatwick Airport. Staff were unfriendly and not helpful at all. Another thing is that the inconvenient online booking system of Emirates. we are a family of 4, 1 of us must be booked separately because of extra baggage weight which lead to we cannot check in together. Furthermore, we successfully checked in online for the first 3 of us but another family member with the separated booking cannot check in online due to overbooked flight. Therefore, we went to the counter to check in and they gave us 4 new seats, including the other 3 of us who checked in online earlier with already selected seats. Also we got new seats without being informed. Also almost all the seats are taken during 47 hours before departure for our return flights, I wonder why.

We were met at the airport and handed (no discussion) a ticket for the next flight (next day 24 hours away) and a hotel voucher. No Emirates agents were at the hotel nor were there any agents at the airport that could answer any question about upgrading or compensation. No one knew anything about anything. Unbelievable. Will never fly Emirates again. There is no customer service for this airline. If you call the 1800 number, they tell you to go online. You go online and it will take a month to hear back. A US carrier could not stay in business with this kind of policy. If you were flying to the Euro zone there are policies for compensating people. Nothing if you fly from the US even on business class.

She was coming from India and it was late night flight from India. She saw a cart at the airport with 2-3 ground staff members sitting in it. She asked them to help her but they said no. How could you do that to a mother of a toddler? The 2nd incident happened to me when I was flying along-with my wife and daughter. The flight was late so they ended up rushing all the passengers to the plane in no time. Then to my surprise although I was standing and carrying my daughter on the lap; the plane started taxiing. Are you serious, what about the safety norms?  I feel most of the times we passengers end up flying with a particular group of airlines because they are members of a club.

The food that is now served was on this particular case of poor quality and not foregoing that the option was let just say not an option (chicken only or nothing). The sweet dish again, was disappointing and finally the clotted cream, resembled more to a true likeness of garlic sauce in a small tub than what was previous served.

Emirates seemed unwilling to acknowledge the issue, offered me 10000 points (hardly worth it) and noted it was possible to 'source a meal from a different section of the aircraft', without an apology for the mistake.

The staff were amazing, my husband and I had been allocated seats apart and although not a major problem for us our stewardess went out of her way to re-seat us once everyone had boarded. Food was superb as was choice of drinks. The seats are individual pods and mattresses offered out as a night flight. We were too excited to sleep but the staff were so friendly and we enjoyed spending time in the bar area and talking to the crew. Obviously travelling business class is going to be an amazing experience but the staff just made it complete. I would just like to say I took the same route in December and was perfectly happy with the whole flight. Leg room good as was food and although the drinks trolley runs are no longer very regular the staff are more than happy to get you something if you ask. Well done Emirates we will definitely be using you again.",1,7th March 2019,United Kingdom
606,"✅ Trip Verified |  I was advised by one of the agents that you can refund a flight booked on FLEX rate but when we tried to request for it they refuse and citing that I shouldn't believe everything the agents say and since I was the one who made the booking it was my fault. Instead they want us to reschedule it and spend $600+ for the fee. I feel there is miscalculations on both sides but they should have been considerate. The worst is when you call their customer support hotline, initially my call was routed to India, when I did follow up on the next day Dubai based support is refusing to take ownership of the case and they blame their counterparts in India. As a Skyward member I will no longer flying with this airline. ",5,7th March 2019,United Arab Emirates

608,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Kathmandu via Dubai. Never fly in their partnership flights We love Emirates. We fly with them even if it is few hundred dollars expensive or a couple of hours longer journey. Appreciate lovely crews, wifi, comfortable seats and food. However, I found that their connection and transit service is worst (cannot compare with any other airport standard) at Dubai and they don’t respect passengers flying with them in partnership arrangements.  Emirates took off 25 min late from SYD. It took additional 20 min to reach to gate at Dubai. Almost 45 min late. Hardly 1 Hr and a bit left for my next flight to KTM. As there was no one waiting at the plane gate, I rushed to Emirates connection centre at Dubai. The response I got there was very upsetting. They were not helping me because my other flight was with flyDubai (which I did not notice earlier as I booked this thru Emirates). Gate number of my flight was not displayed in the Boards. No one helped me, they asked me to wait the gate number to be displayed, which never did. I missed the flight, because the Emirates was late and their information system was not good. They did not bother to help us because we were only 3 passengers in this connection. The following flyDubai flight to KTM was over-booked, so we had to wait next Oman Air flight via Mascot. I reached KTM approx. 18 hrs late to find another surprise. My little suitcase was broken. I made a complain at Sydney and claimed for missing goods. Emirates responded to me in 7 days as - “it is the airline industry policy and agreement between airlines. Oman Air has a direct responsibility to resolve your claim.. suggest that you contact Oman Air.” I was expecting something better than this from Emirates Airlines. My advice, never fly in their partnership flights, avoid Dubai airport connection if possible.",1,6th March 2019,Australia

I have been travelling for many years and don't expect much from airline food, it is usually average, but the food offered on this flight gets a 10/10. Absolutely fabulous from starter to dessert.

From check in at the airport in DC (IAD) the staff were rude, insisted that our luggage be exactly 20lbs (where is the limit is 23lb/bag). The staff in Kabul insisted that I could not take a carry on with me because it was a kilo over the limit whereas I saw others carrying much larger bags than my little carry on bag. They then checked my bag to Dubai (instead of Geneva) and I had to leave the airport, go through the immigration, collect my bag, take another shuttle and come back to the terminal. What a nightmare.

611,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manila to Cape Town via Dubai. Emirates has been incredibly disappointing on so many fronts. The Special meal I ordered didn't show up. As opposed to being super apologetic the airline crew was just rather indifferent. Also the regular meals provided in business class were terrible. Business class felt like economy class service. Staff came out when there was meal service and otherwise just huddled in the cabin and chatted outside of that. Really got the distinct impression that I was bothering them every time I had to go to the cabin to get water. They used to be better. Not sure what happened to this airline. Airport Transfer:  security check points to transfer from one gate to another along with an arduous bus ride. Amenities: Nice Kit but no slippers in the plane. Seats: This was the worst part. The seats are not truly flat bed and just not comfy. It really felt like I was in a 1 star airline.  No free Internet in business class and after paying $15 I got very bad quality internet. No power in the seat. While there was a socket, it was not working.The lounge at Dubai airport is really good",10,5th March 2019,United States
612,"✅ Trip Verified |  Budapest to Dubai. A regular traveler to Emirates, I was very disappointed, once again, by this company's sharply lower performance.  The welcome on the plane is expeditious, the smiles rare. We had two hostesses, one obviously beginner, shy to the point of not being able to look in the eyes while talking to us, and faster than lightning: the tablecloths are literally thrown on the shelves, the drinks served without presentation, she ran most of the time like most hostesses. The dishes had little flavor. Only positive points: the quality of the wines, including Champagne and the plate of cheese. The device ""wifi"" control of audiovisual instruments did not work, despite the repair efforts of a hostess much more experienced, pleasant and smiling, that we saw that during the claim. The limousine service promised in the price of the ticket is non-existent in Phuket, for reasons never explained, and the car provided to Dubai was the worst, dented on its flank must, while we have well reminded the hostess of the counter. we were theoretically entitled to two cars, having two separate tickets. It will be I hope our last experience with Emirates, happily competing on the same lines.  FR:  Voyageur habitué de la compagnie EMIRATES, j’ai été très déçu, une fois de plus, par les prestations en nette baisse, de cette compagnie. Dès l’embarquement – assuré à Phuket par des employés de la THAI AIRWAYS – on est traité comme des animaux, pas de sourire en vue. L’accueil dans l’avion est expéditif, les sourires rares. Nous avons eu deux hôtesses, l’une visiblement débutante, timide au point de ne pouvoir nous regarder dans les yeux en nous parlant, et plus rapide que l’éclair : les nappes sont littéralement jetées sur les tablettes, les boissons servies sans présentation, elle courait la plupart du temps comme la plupart des hôtesses. Les mets n’avaient que peu de saveur. Seuls points positifs : la qualité des vins, Champagne compris et l’assiette de fromage. Le dispositif «  wifi » de commande des instruments audiovisuels ne fonctionnait pas, malgré les efforts de réparation d’un hôtesse nettement plus expérimentée, agréable et souriante, que l’on a vu que lors de la réclamation. Le service de limousine promis dans le prix du billet est inexistant à Phuket, pour des raisons jamais expliquée, et la voiture fournie à Dubaï était la pire, cabossée sur son flanc doit, alors que nous avons bien rappelé à l’hôtesse du comptoir d’accueil que nous avions théoriquement droit à deux voitures, ayant deux billets séparés. Ce sera j’espère notre dernière expérience avec EMIRATES, heureusement concurrencée sur les mêmes lignes.",9,4th March 2019,Switzerland

My flights were operated by Emirates but on my return at Dubai I was informed my flight is changed and I have given another flight operated by flydubai after 4 hours (my Emirates connection was after 1 hour 15 mins). I tried to contact their customer service staff but no one was answering why I am getting flydubai when I paid for Emirates?. In flydubai I had worst experience of my life. They were treating me like I got this flight in free. I contacted Emirates customer service after reaching my destination but again as expected they were not accepting anything.

When I arrived to DXB, I requested my luggage to be off the airplane and was told to wait for 2 hours to be able to collect my luggage. But when I came back to them after 2 hours they told me that the luggage are taken out of the aircraft but I can not take them unless I pay the 2000 Dollars, I tried to explain to them that I had to end my trip in Dubai and I need my stuff and my medicines from the bags but they refused.

619,"✅ Trip Verified |  Vienna to Cape Town via Dubai. This review is about my outbound flight to Cape Town (December 19th 2018). My children and I were denied boarding our flight to South Africa due to not having their birth certificates upon check-in, even though the South African government updated the policy December 1st 2018 (which no longer requires this document as mandatory). Not only did Emirate not indicate at any time during the booking process about this law they refused to reason when I showed them South African's government recent update. Due to the busy Christmas season, we were unable to fly to South African until 3 days later, missed the cruise we were to join and had to embark the ship in Namibia 6 days after the original travel date. We were meant to meet my husband on board the ship and missed out on Christmas because of this mistake. The kids were devastated. We were over EUR€4,500 out of pocket since I had to book hotels, new flights and transfers, all because they hadn't updated their policies. Their customer service department is a joke as the only way I could submit a complaint was through their website online form. Their response (claiming zero responsibility and therefore denying me any compensation) was from a ""no-reply"" email address. Even after I spoke with a customer service rep over the phone I was instructed to submit a new complaint since I couldn't follow up to their response email. I submitted a new complaint, correcting their false claims (that I didn't have a travel letter from my husband, which I did have) and I haven't heard back. My husband and I have been working in the travel & hospitality industry for 25+ years and I am extremely knowledgable in luxury customer service; this is what I do for a living.

Went to Airport early so they can help but the lady in desk could not do it, insisting us to request in Dubai. We had only 1 hour halt that was impossible. The plane delayed so we had 45min to catch the next one. So our son could not sleep well. Also flight attendants did not give kid gift as my son was patiently waiting and seeing others getting it. The issue that mostly annoyed us was the kid meal was same as our meal (beef). How could kid meal be beef understanding that kid refer to 2 to 11 years. We been travelling with Emirates for 9/10 years now and this was worse as expectations from Emirates is higher than other airlines.We would not recommend it to others.

However the service has gone downhill and fast. Firstly the chauffeur pick up was terrible - a surly and moody driver who arrived late wasn’t a great start. The lounge at T3 heathrow was fine but then we arrived to find a plane which whilst cannot be that old given its an A380, was seemingly falling apart. People’s seats didn’t work properly, my TV was broken, and the bar area looked terrible. The cabin crew seemed like they’d just been assembled at the last moment - the service levels were atrocious and disinterested.

625,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Bahrain. So we all know that economy gets you from A to B, safely and we are not expecting much especially with a short hop like this, only a one hour flight. Paid for a extra room seat at Door 3, 24 D being an aisle on the B777. Flight was very full with many children and to their credit two of the crew were very engaging with them and their parents. What I do not get is why Emirates insist on placing ten across high density on all their B777 aircraft - an industry norm these days but it begs belief. As the crew went up and down the aisle I was knocked into over 12 times in less than an hour and I am 78 Kg, some at least had the courtesy to apologize, most did not bother. I get its cattle class but I for one would never set foot on these aircraft in this high density. I find EK crew to be stoic, tired looking, the crew member at my door crew seat looked as if he dying for his bed, head in his hands, yawned non stop and a lot of the crew looked plain disinterested. This is obviously down to crew planning being over stretched. Overall ok, flight deck did a great job with announcements and the flight itself and landing was excellent - true skill. Would not fly long haul based on this, you see a totally different service and staff attitude between J and Y class. Engaged to must I do the basics.",1,19th February 2019,Bahrain
626,"✅ Trip Verified |  I travelled from Manchester to Faisalabad vi. Dubai, and from Manchester to Dubai the service was good. But from Dubai to Faisalabad, Emirates use the service provided by Flydubai, whose service is of a very poor quality. When providing a 'meal' it was just a small snack and when I asked about a hot drink such as a cup of tea, I was told to pay 20 dirhams (roughly £4.21 each), and soft drinks were roughly 5 dirhams (£1.05). I had 3 family members travelling with me (including my elderly parents), we paid over £2000 for tickets alone, and on top of that we were asked for outrageous prices for a service which should be covered by the ticket prices anyway. I contacted Emirates to complain and the email I received in reply was written in a way as though I were at fault, stating things such as ""this is the service we will contnue to provide"" and that I should contact my agent as they should have told me about these extra charges. However, on their booking it says 'meal provided' on both Emirates service and flydubai's service which would suggest that a reasonable meal is given, when in fact it was simply a small snack. A few days later a friend of mine returned from Faisalabad and Emirates were using the same service and the flight was delayed causing the airline to provide a hotel room. The shocking thing was he was told he would have to share a hotel room with complete strangers. No company has a right to do this as it is an invasion of privacy and is extremely invasive. It is clear that Emirates no longer have the same standard of service and I would not use this service again myself, nor recommend it to anyone else in the future.",1,19th February 2019,United Kingdom

Other than a drink with the meal there were no further offers for cups of tea or even water for the rest of the flight. Meal service including clearing trays took extremely long, so not being able to get up to use the toilet for 2 hours isn't great. Staff in general do not seem to be interested.

After the reboot the remotes would not work, either of them so just gave up and watched a movie. Service started very quickly, well if you wait until they go to the rear of BC and then the front, doing us in the middle last, is this the norm? Service was rushed, offered one drink before dinner then service slapdash. They just seemed to want service done and dusted then that was it, go to sleep. Male member in the galley after dinner couldn't have made anymore noise if he had a hammer smashing plates. If this is Business Class then you can keep it.

The Wi-Fi is free for every Skywards member. Since the registration to the program is also free, the service is very good. It is not the fastest one, but definitely with the best value for money.

636,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Cape Town via Dubai. As a very frequent emirates passenger in the past, we have nor used the economy Emirates product for over 4 years. Check in was laborious as a they were checking everyone’s visas which is understandable. Boarding was good. No issues both in AMS or DXB. Onboard service is now a huge let down. On both sectors after take off it took 2 hours before the food service was started. And at no point was a bar service offered. Not just alcohol beverages but water or soft drinks. The food was below average and it was only after the food was eaten the bar service came out. I can on Y assume that Emirates is trying to cut back and save money. But what they don’t realise is the majority of there traffic is in Economy and if you keep cutting the service then people will stop booking. Especially when the completion like Qatar or Etihad offer better service on the same routes. We will not be booking with Emirates economy in the near future as it is not a pleasurable experience anymore. Also I felt the ICE was of a reduced choice as compared to a few years ago.

637,✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Sydney via Dubai. This is a review that is a follow up on my outbound. The reviews are almost identical. Great hard product but the soft product on Emirates is just simply lacking and its down to the crews who are at best very lackadaisical. You have a few who are superb but on the whole it reflects a training problem. Much noise and chat going on which is very annoying during the night routes. One thing I have never seen and clearly much revelry goes on in the Emirates dorms. One female FA groped the boob of another in a playful manner. Now for red hot blooded males this may be fine but sorry this is a major flag carrier. Whilst on the Emirates gripe. The IFE is fine but to be honest was struggling too find some films that really appealed. Emirates caters for a huge language base. Final gripe. The seat quality certainly in economy is dire. The cushioning is hard or maybe has been so well used that it is worn. Come on Emirates. A one time leader has slipped into the pack with a terrible soft product.,9,5th February 2019,Australia
638,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Madrid via Dubai. Being a Qantas FF I occasionally travel on Emirates but with a Qantas code on it. Now same aircraft (A380) but the whole experience is totally different. Have been on Emirates a few times a year mostly when routing to a Europe port other than London. Sydney being the Qantas home base is these days very efficient to get through. Self check in (even though i can use the First counter) and through security and to the Qantas lounge in probably 15 minutes. The Emirates version is very different and rightly so as it is not home base. The economy line up was massive. Fortunately could use the premium line and was through swiftly. Time for Emirates to start using self check in. Used the superb Qantas First Lounge and then moved over to the Emirates lounge which was a very pleasant place. From there the whole experience was pretty dismal. Had a whole row to myself in the main cabin which was great. Same sights and sounds as for the Qantas A380 but its the customer service that lets Emirates down. They just simply have recruited too many young kids who just dont have the professionalism or charm of the slightly older crews on Qantas main line. Its really a training problem. Having crew that speak 30 languages on board is fine but does not help if their manner is to put it mildly rather brusque. Charm school is sorely missing. Mid flight snacks are poor to non existent. Food is a little underwhelming. Delayed start from Sydney due to bad weather and a tight connection meant a run through Dubai T3 to get to the Madrid flight. Same plane, different crew but same lack of charm and professionalism. And Emirates...one other thing. Please do not have your crews take away blankets, act as general cleaners and so on around 30 minutes before landing. It jut is not a great look. Overall the airline needs to employ proper training methods or better still get some older crew who can teach the young ones how to. The fact is that Emirates gets away with sloppy standards since they have a great network, hard product in the A380, great airport in Dubai. For me it is the easiest way to get to Madrid from Sydney so have to get used to a substandard level of service which many people have commented on.

After booking a round trip flight, I had to change the time of the outbound flight for latter on, the same day, due to work commitments. Their customer services explained to me that I will only need to book a one way flight from Europe to Dubai as my return flight, which was already booked, will remain valid. However, one day before the date of my return flight back to Europe, I found out that my ticket had been cancelled due to “no show”, despite being told previously that I will be able to use my return flight. In addition to that, the complaint has been handled extremely poorly, with a complete lack of consideration, by Emirates customer services who repeatedly refused to transfer me to a manager for an official complaint.

I asked for help due to my seat being broken and no help. The staff on this flight were very rude. Usually if a passenger is standing in the back area and looking at the flight attendant, they will ask may I help you, not this crew. The conversation continued until they were finished were their conversation. It was like that I was bothering them or something.

I felt almost inferior. I guess you get what you pay for. From lack of healthy snacks between meals, to not being able to get a bottle of water (because they are for service - even though I ended up drinking the same amount of water every time I got up to look for some). I was so disappointed and am currently dreading my return trip. I might change airlines after this.

642,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. In last years Emirates was my favorite carrier. But now I think their customer service quality has fallen down from top to bottom. Today I finished my trip and all 4 flights I noticed same problems: bad customer service in economy class. Flight attendants not present during almost whole flight. 6-8 hours flight only 2 times passengers got something to drink. Yesterday BKK-DXB onboard very rude flight staff. DXB-MAN attendants were lazy and not very nice. Talking a lot, flirting with themselves and definitely not interested about passengers. Complimentary limited WiFi never connecting. Food is poor, portions are small and tasteless. Return flight to my city someone took from carousel my backpack. Guy from Emirates airport staff whom I asked about help called that passenger who swapped backpacks. Then he told me to wait for that passenger, he will come soon and we can swap the backpacks again. He left me with not my backpack at public area and told me: keep eye on this. I lost two hours waiting and finally airport security guys came to me and asked many questions about what I am doing here. I told them what happened. They did not believe me and checked everything around me with detector and told me this situation is definitely against airport safety rules. Big shame for Emirates.

On my next flight they have re-selected the seating where I cannot set beside my 8 years son for a 14 hours flight - after a long discussion they offered me a seat with my son in the front and my wife with my other son but in the back.

After some time was offered a return business class ticket, Sydney to Bangkok return to be used by October 2019. Not happy but accepted the deal as I needed to be in Sydney. Now, at the end of January I called to redeem my voucher for a flight on August 19th, returning to Sydney 15th. As Emirates have changed their schedule they now refuse to honour the voucher. They have available seats on Qantas code share from Sydney but flatly refuse to accept their own voucher. Emirates did infer that they may be able to offer a Jetstar code share out of Melbourne.

We travelled as a couple and had together 85 kg luggage. 5kg overloaded. 80kg were permitted. With no discussion, I had to remove stuff to my hand luggage. Up in the air when it was the dessert service, I was full so I asked for just some cheese and fruit. The FA said no, you can only can choose one! Cheese or fruits! Are you kidding me? This is the first time that this has happened to me. I've been a frequent business and first class traveller for almost 20 years and have had mostly the opposite experience. In business class even when you are still hungry, you can have more food/desserts whenever you want. After that I went to the Sky bar (which is a nice feature of EK A380) and saw many fruits and more snacks. Very illogical. The FA who denied me my fruit, I saw her mostly in back galley, eating and chit chatting. It's the first time I have travelled with Emirates and maybe the last time.",9,22nd January 2019,Germany

When I reached Ottawa my baggage never arrived and I was told by Westjet Airlines that I was supposed to pick up the baggage at Toronto airport.

On the way back due to their own fault the flight was delay for 1.5 hour and I missed connection flight in Dubai due to airlines fault and next flight they gave me was after 12 hours.

On the next leg from Dubai dinner was a turkey ham roll and that was it for 7 hours until an inedible breakfast was offered. Cheese and cracker with breakfast? Demonstrative of the lack of care and attention by emirates. Dirty planes. Smelly toilets.  I will never fly Emirates again. How reviewers are consistently rating Emirates above BA is beyond me and as we know BA is hardly a high benchmark. A massive TV screen and a large selection of films does not make up for a budget service.

656,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to my business trip I had to travel from Copenhagen Kastrup airport to Dubai and then back to Warsaw to catch my next flight from there. So first part of trip was operated by A380. During Online process I realized there is no more windows seats available. During checkin on the airport I've asked to window seat and I got this seat in emergency row. Also my baggage has been sent without extra costs (I had extra 6kg). At the terminal I've paid to lounge contracted with Emirates airline but it wasn't worth this price (250 DKK, around 33EUR). Boarding at the gate was late around 30 minutes but during this process there was good order, people was queued in the groups. Service on board was good but nothing special comparing to other airlines, meal choice was poor (only dishes with rice). Very good and very stable entertainment system with big selection of movies and games. Also GSM and WIFI network available onboard (I didn't use them at all due to nice passengers travelling next to me, we talked all the time). I land around midnight so traffic wasn't big and all security and luggage pickup in Dubai takes not much (around 1 hour). My flight back to Warsaw was 2 two days later at 8:05. I tried to check-in to choose my seat but it wasn't possible. During my way to the airport I've got an SMS with info I had been seated in the middle. So I went to the airport around 3:30AM and very quickly drop my luggage and pass all security to avoid waiting. It wasn't possible to change my seat, however they seat me in emergency row again. Unfortunately I had been charged for an extra 6 kilos in luggage. Security control was terrible long, they try to find something in my bag but they didn't tell me what they are looking for. I was more clever than on my previous flight and I've put all my cables in checked luggage before to avoid cables confiscated like on my previous flight. I don't understand why ethernet cable is dangerous at Dubai airport but it's ok on all other airports around the world. Inside the airport I found hundreds of people seating and lying on the floor and making passing very difficult in some areas. Whole airport was looking like dormitory for the homeless. Wifi I found overloaded, there was many disconnections during my use. During boarding there was a big mess, airport staff didn't queue people in groups before they start, boarding started 15 minutes after scheduled time. Flight was operated by Boeing 777 and I found seats are more tight than in A380. This travel was terribly uncomfortable. Also I found all meals are with potatoes on this flight (again no choice) and service good but average. All cabin staff on both flights tried to be nice. I arrive very tired.

Two attempts to get the attention of the air stewardesses through the help button for a separate matter were ignored and not responded to at all.

I suffer from severe celiac condition and I am intolerant for any type of wheat and contamination. My father who booked the flights did not know that he had to book Gluten free meals 48 hours in advance, when we arrived at the airport in Malta, we asked at the check-in counter about gluten free meals and they informed us that the only way to get gluten free meals on board was to reserve the meals 48 hours in advance. We discussed with the inflight staff and asked them if they can spare some meat from the business class meals and the flight attended said that that was not possible. When we landed in Cyprus we asked to talk to the flight purser and she said she will see what she can do, Once we left Larnaka-Cyprus to Dubai, we asked if the crew managed to solve the issue, but they said unfortunately not and there was nothing they can do, they said that they informed Dubai so they can prepare food for the next flight, again I was left hungry on the flight between Larnaka-Cyprus and Dubai. My Father offered to pay extra for the business class food, but the staff said no. When we landed in Dubai, the first thing we done was to go to customer help and information desk and asked if the crew have ordered any Gluten free food for the next flight from Dubai to Male, the desk assistant said that there was nothing on the system and she will try and get some gluten free food on-board the next flight but she said she cannot promise.

667,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. My husband and I have flown to Europe previously with Etihad, Qatar, and this year, Emirates. To say Emirates was disappointing and a league behind Etihad and Qatar would be an understatement. Our itinerary was to fly to Athens with Emirates, stay a night in Athens and then fly to Santorini with a different airline the following morning. Upon bag drop in Sydney with Emirates, we were asked if we would like our bags checked all the way through to Santorini. We stated that we had a night in Athens and were flying a different airline to Santorini; however, were reassured that this wasn't a problem at all and we could easily check our bags all the way through. So, for ease, time and convenience, we did; as we trusted that Emirates knew what they were doing. However, upon check in at Athens airport for our flight to Santorini, we were told by our airline that our bags would not have been checked through and we had to go and find them at baggage claim. With baggage claim struggling to locate our bags at baggage claim, we ended up missing our 9am flight to Santorini. As a direct result of us missing the flight, we then had to pay 450 euro for new flights to Santorini (one way for two people ; an equivalent of over $800 AUD), with the new flight scheduled for 5pm. As a direct result of Emirates incompetence, we not only missed our flight, but missed an entire day in Santorini. The anxiety caused from not knowing where our bags were, no one being able to help us, missing our flight, not being able to get onto another flight for another 8 hours, paying 450 euro for new flights, re-scheduling our hotel transfer and dinner booking (meaning that we could not get into the restaurant until 10pm) and having to re-purchase 40 euro train tickets back to Athens caused me to have an anxiety attack in the airport.  The most disappointing part is that Emirates were so difficult to deal with after the incident. We had to wait months to hear back from Emirates if our new flights to Santorini would be paid for; and that was the only compensation they gave. Emirates would not pay for any of my medical bills, our new train tickets or any compensation for our flights to/from Europe despite them causing havoc to our trip. As a result, I would strongly urge people not to fly with Emirates due to their level of incompetence, lack of professionalism and lack of empathy. ",10,22nd December 2018,Australia
668,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Jakarta via Dubai. Emirates online and ground services got it wrong all the way. Going from Barcelona to Jakarta we had planned a stopover in Dubai, we had an hotel for the night and the second flight the day after. So we could travel in eco without being too tired. Unfortunately for us Emirates messed up multiple times. The flight was delayed, that might be a normal safety measure. But then we got no information or wrong information all the way. It’s a wrong strategy to do so with Emirates, as they can mess up your trip fully, and won’t give you more than a poor meal (free poor meal). They can tell you that you will get refunded for your additional expenses and then decline later. All the way to Jakarta, we asked to sleep in Dubai, in Emirates lounge maybe? Explaining we were losing our hotel. The day of departure, after delay notification: Support chat: “I don’t know”. Emirates Barcelona ground service: “I can’t give you anything in Dubai, you should ask there. But you will get the 600 euros indemnity each for severe delay, it should cover all your expenses, in case anyway.""  At Emirates Dubai ground service: “Hi, can we sleep somewhere? We are really tired? - Here is your meal voucher. - But we would like to sleep, we are tired, we are not hungry, really. Can we go to the lounge, maybe? - Yeah.. maybe, try there, here is your meal voucher”. We needed to sleep, we paid the hotel in the airport, around 200 USD. We do the online complaint to Emirates. Emirates feedback: “In accordance with the EC regulation 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of the European Union, you are entitled to EUR 600.00 (Euros Six Hundred only) each.” We fill the form for funds transfer, as requested 7.

The flight attendant came and collected the blankets 45 minutes before the landing and she did that in a firm way, like there was no discussion. I gave her mine (even though I am very cold whenever an AC is on) and had to ask her to let my daughter keep it. She said yes in a way like she was doing a favour to me. Then the lady next seat told her that she needed to keep the blanket, because she was sick and the flight attendant had a back and forth with her until she conceded at the end. Then after that, she came for the headphones 35 minutes before the landing with an almost rude attitude. My daughter and I were nearly finishing our movie and wanted to tell her that, but then I was watching around and no one was saying anything - I felt like I would be the only one complaining. I gave her both headphones and sat there for 30 minutes thinking about this flight. After all, leaving a blanket and a headphone for the passenger until the end of the flight is not asking too much.

Introduced themselves personally and took my son for walks through the plane, gave him a meal & toys, and took a Polaroid keepsake. The flight wasnt full so I had the 4 seats to myself with the bassinet and when someone moved to the aisle seat after takeoff, Natasha said she would find the passenger an alternative seat for both our comfort levels (which was unnecessary but great). Unfortunately, the Dubai-Adelaide leg was terrible. I waited nearly 1.5 hours after takeoff to get the bassinet put up, then during the flight which was really turbulent (not much can be done about that I know), I had to buzz for my food trays to be removed as they sat there for a few hours. An elderly man was I'll in the toilet near where I was seated, and had opened the door whilst doubled over the sink vomiting, so again I buzzed for assistance for him but nobody even came! 2 female crew had an argument in the aisle about 1 getting a food order wrong, and it was just very unprofessional. Had it not been for the assistance of the passenger on the aisle and behind me helping me to reach the overhead compartment etc as i needed nappies and things during the flight, but had my son in my arms for almost 10 of the 12 hours due to the turbulence so was attempting to function using 1 hand, the flight would have been a worse experience.

About 30 min after take off I walked to the galley and asked whether the bar was already open. I received a smile and two glasses of white wine. 15 Min later they distributed food and beverages, where the beverage trolley followed close to the food trolley. Crew worked with a smile. Beverages and food were good for an economy meal, wines were even good.  Throughout the flight crew passed by and served beverages. The IFE was high class and the internet was poor as usual.

673,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Nairobi via Dubai. My husband and I flew with Emirates for the first time and had negative experiences on both flights, there and back. The negative was in Dubai when we were waiting for our second flight. We were told boarding would start 40 minutes before departure and would close 20 minutes before departure. Approximately 50 minutes before departure was the first time the flight was shown on the departure screen with ""FINAL CALL"". We had to run to get to the gate on time as we thought we would miss our flight. When we arrived I asked why they started boarding so early and why there was no announcement for boarding until ""FINAL CALL"" and the hostess replied ""It's protocol"". We received no explicit reason or justification whatsoever. The second was in Nairobi. Their system was down which is understandable that queues were extremely long and service taking a long time as well. However, we received absolutely no announcements as to what was happening and when the flight would take off. We were meant to fly at 10:45pm. After boarding at approximately that time we sat on the plane at the gate for 3 hours until we finally took off at 1:45am the next morning. On that flight I pushed the service button for water as we weren't given anything for those 3 hours waiting on the plane but no one answered my request. I did this twice until I gave up. This wait and level of service was extremely frustrating to most passengers as they had connecting flights with short layovers.

676,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Brisbane. Would never travel with Emirates again with an infant! Dreadful experience with Emirates travelling with our 20-month-old daughter. Flight crew were rude and unhelpful throughout the entire flight. The only time we ever saw them is when they came and barked orders at us!! We purchased 3 full-price seats for myself, my wife and our 20-month-old daughter, however the flight crew didn't offer our daughter any food during the entire 14-hour flight. When we asked the attendant if they had any food for our infant they said they didn't have any and we should have pre-ordered this! However this was the first we'd heard of this, and the lady sat next to us said that she didn't pre-order and her 4-year-old was given a kids meal! Emirates were well aware that we were travelling with an infant so surely they would have some provisions for this! Apparently not.

This is my second review and will keep posting as I am a frequent traveler to Dubai. The host attendant told me their classic sentence ""Sorry sir we ran out of beef"". As I was expecting this answer I stand up and asked her ""How come no one in front 5-6 did not get any beef?"".  She just could not give a logical answer other than that there is a ratio based on customers. I told her that this is a lie as it's my fourth flight I get the same response from them. Besides, I don't understand why do they give you the menu as they never have beef meal on board? It is very obvious that Emirates is doing cost reduction by serving chicken instead of beef. I have another return flight scheduled in a week. I wonder what will I get.",3,17th December 2018,Turkey

682,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Brisbane via Dubai. Our flight from London Heathrow was late, which resulted in us rushing through the transit to book in for the next connecting flight from Dubai to Brisbane (via Singapore). When we arrived at the Dubai check in, it was apparent that there was something wrong but the Emirates staff just talked amongst themselves. After some 15 or 20 other passengers checked in after us for the same flight (5 of them Business Class customers) the Emirates staff told us that they had changed our seats and we couldn't sit together, but they offered no reason for this, I told the staff that we had booked these seats and my partner was a nervous flyer so we could not sit in separate locations. They said you have no choice, I asked to be upgraded to 1st class, they refused, I offered to travel on the next flight 02.30hrs (some 5 hours later), I was abruptly told that our luggage was on the flight that we were originally booked on (21.15hrs) and we needed to board that flight as it was departing in a few minutes. Their attitude for Business Class customers (or any customer) was deplorable. We arrived at Brisbane, but our luggage didn't, the staff at Brisbane were helpful but couldn't tell us where it was, as it hadn't been 'scanned in' at Dubai. I then got access to text messages on my mobile phone, which I couldn't obtain whilst on the flights, for some reason, the text read 'due to operational reasons we have had to transfer you to the flight that departs from Dubai at 02.30hrs', why didn't the staff at Dubai know about this instead of refusing me travel on this service, especially when I had offered to do just that. We waited at Brisbane, for the next flight to arrive, but still no luggage. It took Emirates 3 days to get our luggage to us, by this time we had travelled to Cairns as this was how we had booked our holiday and accommodation. On our return flight to London, which departed from Melbourne, we checked in and the staff said 'due to the flight being full we have changed your seats', from Dubai to London. I couldn't understand why this would be necessary just because the flight was full, again I refused this and asked to be upgraded, no was the reply. We then had to wait at the customer service desk and they eventually explained that they had e mailed Dubai and we had got our original seats, although the staff pointed out to me that the seats were only a request and not guaranteed, I showed them an email from Emirates which confirmed the flight and seat details, from the outset of the booking. The Emirates customer service desk operative made a point that she had done us a favour, in getting our original seats back. When we arrived at Dubai check in, again we were faced with 'we have changed your seats'. I couldn't believe this and again had to wait and argue to get our original seats. The staff on the plane were very attentive and polite on all legs, but the staff on the ground just don't care, rude and not worthy of the Emirates uniform. I asked several times 'how much do you want me to pay before you start giving us some level of service' I have written to Emirates with the complaint and incredibly they have referred it to Qantas, because Emirates were only operating the flight on their behalf, how that works when it was the Emirates staff who caused the issues I don't know.",6,11th December 2018,United Kingdom
683,"✅ Trip Verified |  Istanbul to Dubai. For the third time in a row, Emirates served only chicken meal to me on their flight. Their general excuse is ""Sorry sir but we ran out of beef"". This was my third flight in 2 months where I got the same reply. First I thought it was just my bad luck being related to the seat I have chosen. But I always pay extra for my seat selection and this time I had chosen the front section of the plane. Oddly enough I noticed that all the passengers on my front and back were also very angry about being forced to eat chicken. I will be also posting my next flight info which is scheduled for this Friday.

684,"✅ Trip Verified | Manchester to Singapore via Dubai. We flew Emirates on each leg of our trip to Singapore. The first leg on Sunday 25th November 2018 (Manchester -Dubai) was excellent, the crew were attentive and very pleasant. The next leg (Dubai-Singapore) was less pleasant the crew less attentive. The return flights (8th December)were much more unpleasant the aircraft was full on both legs but that should not have had any bearing on the complete lack of interest that the crew displayed. On the first leg my wife felt as though she was about to vomit, I went with her to the back of the plane and asked a member of the crew for some advice (He was chatting to two other crew members at the time) his response was to point to a toilet at the rear and said “Sick bags in the restroom” no other concern was expressed. The leg from Dubai to Manchester was over night leaving Dubai at 2.55am for at least three hours we saw no crew at all, anything we needed had to be requested by a visit to the curtained off galley. Overall we were extremely disappointed by the standard of service, far less than we expected. The uniforms of the crew are probably the smartest in the business but along with this must go an equivalent level of customer service. This was our first trip with Emirates but I expected far more from them than this. Good clean aircraft, food only so-so, good timekeeping but oh dear! The level of service fell far below what should be a standard.",5,10th December 2018,United Kingdom

It is a minimum of 29.5 hours so pay for extra leg room as the upgrades do increase phenomenally. This flight was booked a year ago and seats approximately the same time with added expense of leg room with really good seats. It was the last flight from Dubai to Manchester today only to be told that it was not a available and that I had to sort my refund out; thus handing me card with information. No upgrade was offered; actually it was refused! It would have been considerate if they could have contacted us and discussed the issue. Instead we could have 3 seats to ourselves, how kind seeing the airplane was half full. It would have been interesting to see what would have happened if it was full. All this was because the plane had changed, it was still and A380 guys. Seats all in the same place! I’m not happy and seriously considering using a different airline from now on. I do this route at least once a year at a considerable cost for 2. I hope we get suitably refunded by this ""excellent airline"".",10,7th December 2018,United Kingdom
687,"✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Colombo via Dubai. Worst airline. Flight staff was horrible and rude. I tried to asked why I kept getting food with dietary restrictions when I have none. On the flight home they assured me nothing was noted for special diet and sure enough on the 17 hour flight I had nothing since I don’t eat fish and that’s what I was served for my ‘dietary restrictions’ - two out of the four flights the seat did not recline. WiFi was not working on any flight. Finally was able to talk to someone and they gave us info on who to contact. Almost 6 months later with over 8 attempts to contact company to see if they would be able to listen to our concerns and issues we experienced - nothing. Their customer service over the phone is even worse. I’m not one to give a bad review but when you’re spending thousands of dollars and give almost 6 months for the company to hear me out and make it right, I need to warn other people.",5,6th December 2018,United States

Seated upfront 2nd row Economy. Presumable friends, the first row 3 male passengers were making so much noise throughout the night flight. No one could sleep in my section. Being a night flight, the Emirates staff not only failed to request them to tone down in consideration to other passengers. But what shocked most passengers is to see one of the Emirates staff is part of the noise making throughout the flight with the 3 men. Seated herself at the crew exit seat facing them. Extremely unprofessional for any staff to act in this manner by disregarding passengers comfort. Next, the food was poorly presented. Budget airlines like AirAsia has better food. Service is below average. Cabin crew comprising of multi nationalities don't seem to be working as a team. Next, the seats were extremely uncomfortable.

689,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuala Lumpur to London via Dubai. Having a stopover at Dubai now enroute to London. Decided to check on why Emirates was below expectation. Initially wanted to keep my experience to myself but not after reading Skytrax reviews on Emirates. First and foremost, I was allotted the worst seat anyone can get. Seat 66H,  the lavatory seat. Wrote to Emirates 3 days back, I am in Dubai now, my flight is done, but no response from them. Luckily upon online check-in, I decided to change my ""aromatic"" seat - and I had to pay extra for a different seat. Emirates should not sell or make money from this row of seats. Esp when there are still empty seats on the flight for sale or seat change for extra payment. Its downright unacceptable and disgusting from a country that prides itself to be super rich operating the 2nd largest A380 fleet. I know now, I was fooled by all of Emirates advertisements and their perceived image. On to the flight, the flight was below expectation. Economy class cabin crews' attention and attitude got heaps to improve. Giving me the immediate impression that Emirates only crave and care for Business and First Class passengers attention, I guess Economy class passengers are only herds of cattle to them. The food was bland and presentation was poor. And the Emirates A380 economy seat is very uncomfortable Someone should remind Emirates management, that Economy class service ultimately differentiates an airline from its competitors and generates the most revenue for any airline Anyone wants to fly Emirates? fly Business or First, never Economy.",2,4th December 2018,Singapore

No apology was given for the limited choices and the FA gave a take it or leave it tone with us. The snack was served shortly after and no one bothered to collect the trash from us after that.

Controller of mini screen don’t come out, ask crew member to help, she pressed several times and replied “if you can’t take it out I can’t too”. Asked whether we want chicken or beef, we said beef, crew member say I will take a look and never come back again.

We boarded on time and even though it was a busy service (full business class) we were very well looked after by a professional cabin crew. Food and wines offered on the nearly 7 hour flight was very good and of highest standard. We even had time to enjoy a cocktail at the bar and relax before we started our descent into Hamburg.

696,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Athens. When we received the email from Emirates to check in we were offered an upgrade to Business for $600 per person.  We took it, thinking that we would be wowed by Emirates world class service, food and reputation. Read on. After checking in online we called to find out more about Emirates' car service, knowing we were outside the 50 mile radius we were willing to pay the difference. ""No' we were told, ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so you are not eligible"". Really? Even if we would pay for it? After we checked in at the airport we asked where the lounge was located. ""No"" we were told ""you booked the super saver upgrade, so that doesn't get lounge access"". Funny, didn't see mention of that when Emirates took my $1200. (we got into the lounge any way). Boarded an old 777-200. It was late (almost midnight). We had a nice cocktail and dinner and went to sleep. Forgot to put the sticker on my shirt and so 2 hours before landing, and in the middle of a nice deep sleep, was awoken by the FA who asked what I wanted for breakfast (even though he could see I was sound asleep). My husband was out like a light and the FA said ""I guess he doesn't want breakfast"". Astute observation. Before I went to sleep and after I woke up I tried to find something to watch on the IFE. Nothing. It was late so there was no question that we would be sleeping, but the seat was not full flat and the hard arm rests were hard to maneuver around. Overall I would say that I was glad we got to upgrade, but felt sorry for those folks who paid a lot more than we did for the same experience.",2,20th November 2018,United States

Meals were served almost 80-90 minutes after take-off. On the return journey flight took off from London at 20.30 and my turn (middle of the Aircraft) came at 22.00.

699,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Houston. I have never experienced such a complete & total lack of professionalism, by any airline. Travelers can encounter a problem on any airline, but it is how an airline handles a problem that is most important. This experience on EK was a ""case study in abject incompetence"". The flight was boarded on time, but departure time came & went, & passengers were left sitting, with zero flight deck contact for almost 1.5 hours before the 1st contact by The Captain. There had been a problem with a smoke detector in the crew's sleeping cabin, but it would soon be fixed & we would be ""on our way in about 15 minutes"". Yet again, we sat with no update k for over another hour, by which time the flight was 2.5 hours late. The Captain then made a 2nd announcement that it had taken longer to fix the problem than anticipated, but we would ""now depart in about 10-15 minutes"". However, for a 3rd time, passengers were left sitting another 1+ hour with no flight deck contact. What kind of flight crew training does EK provide, where a Captain thinks it is OK to let passengers sit in silence on a flight delayed 3+ hours, yet make only 2 incorrect announcements? After sitting for 3.5 hours the Captain direct all passengers to collect their belongings & deplane. So 100's of passengers deplane, but those in 1st & Business Class on the upper deck had another surprise waiting. Neither the Captain, or the flight crew had alerted ground staff that upper deck passengers had been directed to deplane. As a result, all 1st & Business Class passengers were crammed at the end of the jetway in front of the 2nd floor elevators, with no place to go! Passengers could enter the elevators, but security had disabled the floor selection buttons after the plane had originally boarded. Passengers started to bang on the glass walls to try & get the attention of security staff who could be seen in the distance, but unable to hear through the heavy glass walls. Passengers finally returned to the plane to tell the ""totally clueless"" flight crew, there was no place to go & passengers were trapped in the small  2nd floor area. Security personnel finally noticed passengers banging on the wall & 1 unlocked a 5th floor door & came to the 2nd level via stairwell, since they also could not operate the elevators. This employee then directed all 1st & Business Class passengers to carry all their belongings up 6 flights to the 5th floor Business Class Lounge! What a fiasco of total incompetence. The flight ended up being 5.5 hours late, but once airborne, passengers quickly learned that even though the plane had sat at the gate for almost 6 hours, it had not been re-catered, so the flight was serving a ""breakfast"" menu, even though the flight departed at almost 4:00PM. No dinner would be served, but rather a light snack, since the menu was still for the ""original"" flight times. After flying for 25 years, I have never experienced a more incompetent flight operation. Not 1 EK employee mentioned any compensation, even though  passengers should have received some type of compensation! ",10,15th November 2018,United States

I had a 20 hour layover in Dubai on my return and Emirates was to provide me hotel and meals in Dubai on my scheduled return date of November 14. However, even though I used the exact same flight combination for my return from TVM to Dubai and Dubai to DFW on November 8, Emirates refused to provide me hotel and meals at Dubai. I had to pay an extra $85 for hotel and approximately $50 for meals. As it is, I paid $1,609.54 originally for the ticket which I thought was overpriced and an additional $375 in penalties and fare difference for changing my return date. I am left wondering whether Emirates is in the business of providing air transportation or of highway robbery.

Odessa to Hanoi via Dubai. I had a very bad experience with Emirates. On 3rd July, 2018 my wife and I took a return flight from Odessa (ODS) to Hanoi ((HAN) via Dubai (DXB); After checked-in, We have waited in long time over boarding time, and then a lady likes a Representative of EK appeared and made a contact with passengers in lounge to announce that flight was delayed more. And in long time waiting that lady appeared again to notice that the incoming flight from DXB landed in Kishinev (Moldova)- KIV and then flew back at ODS in a couple time. We and passengers on this flight have continued to wait. Nearly 02 hours later the lady informed that the incoming flight would flight back to ODS, but crews were over duty time then there would be no outgoing flight to DXB from ODS, it means flight today cancelled. The alternative flight ODS-DXB would be on next day morning, but she didn’t know when! How should I do when I was sure that We missed connecting flight from DXB to HAN? I showed our tickets, mentioned her that our connection flight to Hanoi and asked her what solution would be done for us. I received an answer from her: “I cannot do anything here because there is no computer, no system. I have only telephone!” Even She didn't care on my connection ticket. And she informed that Passenger were provided meals and hotel for that night and would take flight on next day but she didn’t know when! Emirates representative at ODS airport didn’t offer me any alternative protected trip except meals an hotel for that night! No answer, no choice offered by Emirates for me. It’s was terrible and truly that Emirates have set own passengers like me and my wife aside and had no care. Fortunately, there was an flight from ODS to HAN later at 09:30PM by Turkish airlines on the same day. I requested Emirates representative to make endorsement to TK, but She replied that she couldn’t do it. I requested her make a confirmation letter about EK flight cancellation to get refund later. She replied that I could get refund where I bought tickets and there people would know everything in airline system! Finally, I myself had to purchase 02 tickets on TK on the same day to fly back home.

702,"✅ Trip Verified |  Madrid to Male via Dubai. I have never flown Emirates until last October 27 in a holiday trip with my wife to Maldives. Madrid to Male was nothing special: economy seats have average pitch, ICE system works fine and movies selection is huge apparently. Service onboard was quite bad, food was average, flight attendants were rude, the purser spent the whole flight shouting at the crew. They never asked if we wanted more bread or more cafe etc. The flight from Dubai to Male was scheduled at 3:15 am, so we wanted nothing but sleep. Even if we put on all of our ""resting stuff"" the flight crew woke up us at 5 am for breakfast. She said that she must assure that everyone on board was offered breakfast. On our return flights we found another surprise. As the travel agency gave us the booking reference two months ago I purchased the seats, as the fare the agency took did not allow to choose seats. I paid 140€ for the seats. So far so good until we checked in at Male airport. Our seats were changed with no reason. In both flights (MLE-DXB and DXB-MAD). The handling staff could not tell me any reasonable reason, and the finished with a great ""ask Emirates staff when you arrive to Dubai"". Great answer from a professional employee. But when I tried to get an explanation at Dubai my luck did not get better: after twenty minutes trying to hold a conversation, one person who supposedly was in charge gave me a piece of paper with a web site written and told me to fill an online claim. Great airline, great staff, great service. Onboard more of the same: bad service, rude crew, poor food and added to my other trip: my entertainment system did not work.

There were many, many children and some would not stop crying. The few bathrooms became dirty fast and stayed that way through the flight. Finally, the food was mediocre at the best.

The result, impersonal service when there was the luxury of time to do much better. Several requests for drinks etc were misunderstood, because it seemed that the crew were making incorrect assumptions about what I wanted, instead of taking the time to ask and listen!

Eventually next day we back to Perth airport by now the excitement was gone so then mid flight was told one piece of luggage was left behind and will follow shortly but did not receive till day 3 so had to buy clothes - very disappointed to see it had been cut right across the top so we had to buy a new suitcase. Then on our return to Perth we had pre paid seats only to be told somebody else was in them so we by now we’re most upset, but disappointed at the manner and rudeness of the staff in flight - especially a manager who shrugged and said Oh well bad customer service.

So to my very surprise, when I got to the Stansted Airport check in counter 3 hours before my flight departure, the staff at the check in counter told me that I was actually a “stand by” passenger from Dubai to Hong Kong which they could not actually check me in and print my boarding pass, they said I could only confirm my seat when I arrive Dubai and they could do nothing in Stansted. I said to them that my seat status is always written as Confirmed on online tracking and I could not accept such an uncertainty only to find out if I will get a seat to Hong Kong when I arrive Dubai. The staff only explained because the plane was overbooked and I was chosen (randomly?). I had flown numerous airlines in my life,  but such thing was never happened, but only with Emirates! Even though with my insistence, the issue was solved and I got a seat at Stansted, this incident already left me a bad impression about this airline. If there is an option, I’d doubt if I will ever fly with Emirates ever again as this experience was no fun at all.",5,29th October 2018,United Kingdom

709,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Rome via Dubai. I have been waiting for longer than months since my flight last July with no response from Emirates all.  First I had no idea why Emirates is delayed for 6 hours out of JNB was because of technical issues which caused me to missed my connecting flight to Europe. The IFE on my seat does not work since this is an old plane that I've take and this is unacceptable for me to go without IFE on such a long flight. Upon arrival into Dubai, I was rescheduled to another day with Emirates as the result of the delay flight. I have nowhere to sleep by then. This is unacceptable and a total nightmare for the whole journey. After longer time since I sent a report to Emirates without any answer at all. This is the last time I fly Emirates.",1,18th October 2018,South Africa

I booked the wheelchair for my grandparent, i didn’t get any help or information from her when we check so my grandparents had to walk way to plane. There were so many peoples who were carrying too many bags but did’t weigh their luggage and bags - but why only us.  I don’t mind for paying but it should be fair to everyone. So unhappy with the emirates flight never going use this airline again. Paid £88 for nothing ",1,17th October 2018,United Kingdom
711,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Dubai. A cabin crew damaged my belongings.  Just before the captain commenced descent, against my advice, staff shoved and crushed several of my airport purchases into a almost full overhead compartment above me, in my full view. Prior to this, I'd request twice for assistance to find a suitable space, not the one above me, but my request was totally ignored. Upon landing for disembarkment, I approached the cabin crew supervisor and showed him the damages done on my purchases by one of his crew. He expressed his apologies and advised I write in to Emirates as there nothing other than apologies he can offer. He was also shown the almost-full state of the compartment directly above us where the packagings were crushed and damaged. I wrote to Emirates and below is their ""not my problem"" template reply from Customer Service Thank you for your correspondence of 03 October 2018 regarding Emirates flight EK 186 from Barcelona to Dubai on 29 September. I regret to learn that you found your biscuit box dented on the above flight. However, I am required to highlight that personal belongings brought onboard are the responsibility of each individual passenger, and the airline cannot accept responsibility for loss of, or damage to, personal items. According to our records, as you were sitting in the bulkhead row, you were advised that all bags and loose items have to be stowed for landing in the overhead lockers. It is my understanding that you did not inform the cabin crew that your bags contained fragile items. Notwithstanding the above, we certainly appreciate you bringing your experience to our attention, and I wish to assure you that your comments, along with the Cabin Supervisor's report, have been shared with the departments concerned. This enables them to take appropriate internal action to improve the standard of service offered to our customers. I can also advise that the cabin crew operating in Economy class on this flight have received guidance in this regard. Please accept my apologies for not having met your expectations on this occasion. I hope that we can leave you with a more positive impression on your future flights with us. Emirates services from both cabin and ground (customer service) had changed over the years and this has been the worst I'd ever encountered. ",5,17th October 2018,Singapore

I was traveling for business purposes, so I needed to take 6 bags and was willing to pay the extra fees for the many overweight pieces of baggage. I agreed to pay $950 for the baggage to be accepted and taken to my destination, which was Hargeisa. When I got to Dubai, they canceled my connection flight to Hargeisa, so they rescheduled me onto an Ethiopian Airline flight to Hargeisa, which I was fine with, but later I wanted a refund because, in order for my bags to reach the destination, I had to pay $1600 to Ethiopian Airlines, and the agreement with Emirates was to take my baggage to my destination for the $950. I asked Emirates for a refund because they canceled the flight and rescheduled me,  but they refused and said it's not their fault and since I paid the $950 and used Emirates airlines until Dubai, they cannot accept my refund.",4,16th October 2018,United States
715,"Not Verified |  Sydney to Paris via Dubai. I have been travelling with Emirates with the past 10 years. I flew for the second time in business class and the service has been the worst I have ever had. A had a stop over in Dubai, and I had a confirmation email from Emirates and a print out from the Emirates counter in Sydney while I did my check-in. A chauffeur was booked to pick me and my daughter up and we had a hotel room booked complimentary from Emirates. When we arrived in Dubai, no one from Emirates helped me to find my chauffeur. I went to the Emirates counter and the person who was really unhelpful, cancelled my booking without asking me anything and was very rude! I had to wait for hours at the airport with my 17 months daughter. I was expecting much more from the business class from Emirates. The cabin crew during the flights was average. While my daughter was sleeping I asked one one of the crew to look after her while I was in the bathroom. She showed me that she was really annoyed to help me, she finally decided to stay as I asked her if I could get someone else to help me if she didn't want to do it. The cabin crew was eating food in front of clients and was not in a hurry to help clients. I sent a complain on the Emirates website and they answered that it will take up to 30 days before I hear from them - this unacceptable. The business class is expensive enough to deserve the treatment that goes with it. I will never book another business flight ticket with Emirates anymore.",5,15th October 2018,Australia

The in flight entertainment is arguably one of the best, the food is okay (nothing special but good enough), but the service provided by the flight attendants was absolutely appalling. I received no help whatsoever from the stewardess nearby in loading/unloading my baggage, even though I was clearly seen struggling. I was very thirsty mid-flight and requested for the flight attendant to ask for water, but unfortunately no one showed up. The general attitude was unfriendly and unenthusiastic. I would absolutely opt for alternative airlines (and there are plenty) when making this trip in the future.",1,11th October 2018,Indonesia

Qantas was far superior.",2,10th October 2018,United Kingdom
719,Not Verified |  Manchester to Mauritius via Dubai. First flight with Emirates. Not impressed. On outward and inward flights our choice of meals were not available. On return flight sea food only available. I'm allergic to this so did not have a meal. No amenity kits were available despite all flights being long haul. I enquired via live chat if I could take a hand bag and a small piece of cabin luggage before I flew. I was told strictly one piece only per person. Most ladies had a hand baggage and a travel bag with them. Travelled with golf bags and only were allowed 30kg including suitcases. Most other airlines allow much more than this. Not impressed at all.,1,9th October 2018,United Kingdom
720,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Johannesburg. Emirates is a joke. We were given a ""E"" and ""F"" seats at check in, on a horribly tight 3-4-3 configuration. We asked if we could be given a window or aisle seat but was refused. The check in staff then called her supervisor and said ""Hi, I am calling as two passengers would like to change their seats. I want to call because I want to let them know I have put in my effort and you can just say a no so I can please them"". This is humiliating. On the flight, the seats were the tightest I have met in economy class. The highly rated ICE system was a joke - they claimed to have over 3000 hours of inflight entertainment but in fact, most movies were the unpopular or old ones. The so called free wifi allowed you for 10 minutes of messaging only.  The food is ok, but nothing to cry for. The crews were mostly impolite, and even for the polite ones, not proactive to help on anything. We had a tight connection (1 hour which we need to collect our bags and recheck again) and asked if we could be seated to the front of the aircraft for quick disembarkation. One of the crews ignored our requests and the one other one just said, ""oh, do it on your own"". This is the most horrible flight I have had with international flights!",1,7th October 2018,Hong Kong
721,"Not Verified |  I have flown with Emirates over several years but I won't be after my recent trip to the UK. On both legs (to Birmingham/return to Melbourne) the service left a lot to be desired after many years of excellent service. My wife who had asked for diabetic meals (in advance) had white rolls/sandwiches given to her - as was the diabetic passenger - next to her. They both explained to the staff that brown bread is what they had asked for as white bread is a no-no for those suffering with diabetes. Most of the other contents of the meals were not conducive with those with diabetes. The ""hot"" meals were late in there delivery on most occasions. There was obviously something wrong as staff members were arguing with one another saying who was at fault or wasn't. Either way, it wasn't very professional and disappointing for the customers to hear this going on - I was seating in the row in front of the cabin crew prepare the meals. I wouldn't have minded if it had only happened the once but it happened on our return flight. One has to ask why is moral so low with the Emirates air crew on Emirates these days? Why should passengers be bearing the toxic atmosphere and second rate customer service. Until there management (who the buck stops at) get there act together, I won't be rushing back to them when there are better air crews to fly with!  I didn't get an apology (neither did anyone else) off the flying crew as to why it took 50 - 60 minutes to disembark from the plane? ",3,6th October 2018,Australia
722,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Athens via Dubai. Emirates is an overpriced airline with too much marketing budget and no substance, one that I would advise others to never fly on unless they have no other options. The flight was bad, but not funny or interesting experience bad - just depressing and frustrating and not worth the money you pay for it. My food wasn't served until 6 hours into the flight (on my side of the aisle, the other side got served an hour or two earlier), attendants did not respond to the call button, and when they did serve you they did not speak, smile or even respond with a ""yes or no"" (when asked to bring water). Which was strange considering that had two shifts on board - so there was a lot of attendants wandering around, but none of them seemed to be working. The attendants ended up being more of a nuisance than service - because there were so many of them, they used the passenger's overhead bins in my area (4-5 bins, about 5 rows both sides) for their items and passengers were left with no space. In an attempt to hire as many nationalities as possible, the crew had no cohesion or chemistry - they split off into sub groups based on nationality/language and spent most of the flight gossiping and chatting with their friends. There was audible laughter when the screen popped up with a ""what did you think of this flight"", followed by several ""terrible"" from the rows in front and behind us. The in-flight entertainment system was dated and old; movies not modern and recent, and the Business Class lounge experience during the transfer in Dubai was atrocious and left a lot to be desired (again, on the service side of things). These are minor issues but the flight was so terrible that these other issues are amplified and made worse. If you're considering Emirates look at the reviews on this website, they have a 6/10 rating, which is lower than most other airlines.",1,30th September 2018,Australia
723,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Cebu via Dubai. We booked through a travel agency which gave us separate bookings for every person. Online Check-in should be standard and Emirates offers it. However, the Website is hard to navigate and it takes ages to load. Then, two of us (two out of five) could not check in online. So we went to the airport and checked in the classic way. We were checking in four hours prior to departure. The first Check-in agent was really friendly, but unfortunately, she handed us over to a colleague who was rude. We tried to get seats near each other, she said no seats available.  There are hundreds of people in the queue behind us and you tell us they all have seats and you can't change it? They didn't all do the online check-in because there were seperate queues. So we don't get seats near each other, okay. We go to the gate and there is the next problem: There is a pre-boarding area. They had to get us out of there two hours before departure. It was a mess. There, they could suddenly magically change our seats. So ground service seems to be good or bad depending on your fortune. So the flight was normal. Legroom was okay but not outstanding. Recline of the seat wasn't working. The meal was great. IFE had a awesome choice, but unfortunately there was two minutes of ads before every film. When we arrived in DXB, we went to the costumer service to ask if we could get seats near each other since we were spread all over the plane. The staff was again rude and not motivated at all. She said she could not do anything for us. We got to the gate and picked up some free ice cream form Emirates (That was great, keep it up!) on the way. There was again this strange kind of first stage boarding. It was a mess. When I got my boarding pass scanned, the agent told me I've got an upgrade. Now, I don't want to complain about the upgrade, but why didn't they tell us at costumer service? They scanned our boarding passes there, and all in all three of us five go an upgrade, one of which had a gluten free meal. So they have planned the upgrade in advance. If they would have told us, we wouldn't have spent two hours on the floor.  Onboard, the Business Class was in a 2-3-2 configuration with angled flat beds. If I had paid money for this Business Class, I would have been mad at myself to not have flown any other airline. The FAs were polite, but not going out of there way to be polite. The meal was good.  No FA passed through to take care of passengers except for the meal times. This is below standard as well as the seat. In the IFE, there is the same ad as in Eco.  All in all, I don't recommend paying for this.",1,28th September 2018,Germany

Inflight catering was above good and the portion was generous. The crew service was a big let down. Meals service took longer than expected as the flight was 99% full.

It was ok, nothing more than other airlines, actually the seat was not comfortable enough (business class) had part of the seat pressing against my arm left bruises that turned blue two days ago. That was because the seats are too narrow. Fly another business class and you will see the difference. Wifi was a trouble to connect to. I must say the A380 as a plane is impressive but the way it was designed inside was not the best. On my 2nd leg of the trip we flew the 777-300ER and what a terrible seating arrangement. I cant believe how they thought of putting the touch pad where you are supposed to put your hand letting you feeling you are tied during the flight. Very bothersome.

727,"Not Verified |  Writing review while in the aircraft to Dubai - EK 762 at 2158 Dubai time (24th September 2018) seat number 9D. Emirates business is deteriorating. 1) Check in: I had to wait at JNB because they were calling economy passengers to Business check in. 2) Lounge: Lounge at JNB quite good. The gentleman at d reception is rude and never smiled. In my over 100 lounge visits this year, never saw someone like him. He was busy on internet checking share prices. 3) Boarding: boarding was ok because boarding started before I came and mine was quick. 4) Flight: This particular business class experience is my worst to date. When I ordered a drink it took 20 mins. When I go to fetch it, the very rustic stewardess tells me she has to follow a certain order. And actually makes me wait another 10 mins before I get my drink. Food was shoddy from the first dish other than the apple tart. When I was sleeping they were celebrating with serving wine and other sweets to different couples, make them wear the funny Emirates hat and six of them including passengers were laughing away to glory while clicking pics. All this as promotion for Emirates when lights are out and people like me are trying to catch some sleep. Economy class, for third the price, offers much better experience. There is a reason why a Singapore or Qatar or Etihad get five star rating while Emirates can only make four. I am pretty convinced not to buy Emirates business class tickets for personal trips.",4,26th September 2018,South Africa

730,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Nairobi. Emirates has been my preferred flying choice for both work and personal even including my family as well. To be treated like the way I was came as a complete shocker since never ever been treated like this prior to this unworthy experience. I had arrived from my flight from Taipei (Flight EK367) and was connecting Nairobi via this flight. I had 4 hours and proceeded to shop at Duty free as mentioned above has been my trend. I had checked in one luggage of 23KG in Taipei.I shopped for Chocolates. Upon heading to the boarding gate, I was stopped by an Emirates staff  who demanded I weigh my luggage before boarding. I was irritated as I noticed other passengers boarding without being stopped to and they had more luggage. I assume this must be a routine check. My boarding luggage was 4KG excess. This was understandable considering the duty free items bought. I requested the lady to consider as I had only checked in one luggage and if need be, they check in my luggage. The lady suggested I speak to the gentleman. The gentleman would not hear of it! He was rude and started telling me if I want to complain, I can do that but I have to pay the excess! My luggage cannot be checked in! Since time was running out, I proceeded to pay for the excess luggage of 4KG. Upon waiting to issue my boarding pass, two gentlemen in front of me who were boarding had more luggage and the ladies (Different completely from the one who requested to check) told the gentlemen that they would check in their luggage without even checking how many luggage they originally had checked in! How unfair! When I started to complain, I was told time is running out and should proceed for the aircraft. The whole flight was a mess and I did not enjoy due to me being stressed out and worried about the funds I had paid whilst people in the aircraft had more luggage than me.Is this really fair?  I do not mind paying for excess but a fair check has to be done across everyone boarding.",1,18th September 2018,Kenya
731,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Dubai. Emirates will make you pay for an exit row seat and refuse any sort of refund when they move you involuntarily at the last minute due to a broken seat. Unfortunately a very poor experience and I feel cheated out of the extra money i paid for exit row seats. I was told at the boarding gate as I was about to board that my 2 prepaid exit row seats ($360 paid extra on top of my normal ticket) has a broken entertainment unit. The boarding gate staff advised me that they can move me to a normal seat and refund me my $360. I was annoyed but confirmed with the staff member on the spot that he will ensure I get refunded. He assured me he will see to it and moved my allocated seats. 4 weeks has passed with no refund. I contacted Emirates via their website and explained my situation and they refuse to consider a refund - Basically I paid for a service that I did not receive on my booked flight. I will keep following up this matter with Emirates. They do not provide any contact details or means to contact them other than a very restrictive e-form on their website.

After almost an hour again, they offered me to transfer seat. Initially, I'm hesitant because I love my seat and its pretty quiet, but I realized that without entertainment for more than 7 hours of flight will kill me. Now, I find myself at 67G, which is also an ""exit"" seat.

738,"✅ Trip Verified |  Muscat to Guangzhou via Dubai. Everything was good in the inbound flight and there was no issue. On the other hand, my outbound flight had many issues. First of all, the agents who handled the check in were not polite and knowledgeable of English so that they can understand passengers and passengers can understand them. I had an agent who told me that I have 19kg excess baggage while I was sure that I have checked the baggage three times in my hotel and they were with in the limit. I asked the agent to double check and put them on the scale again individually since he was putting them all together and hand calculating the total weight. The agent refused to do so and refused to ask for his supervisor to come and kept saying ""It is Dubai, Check with Dubai"" He was about to return all the bags to me until I make the payment, I told him Ok check the bags and finish the check in so that my family and I will go and do the payment. He said ""first make payment and then will check the bags""! He kept my family standing there with my children and I went to do the payment. When I asked the other agent also to go and check or ask that guy in the counter to check she refused and said the same ""check with Dubai"". I paid the $570 for 19kg which I really think it is ridiculously insane charge for 19kg. In front of the gate, several agents were collecting the carry on bags to check them in for free and they did check all my carry on bags that weighs more than 20kg. Then they asked to take my cabin friendly baby stroller to check in because they where not aware of this type of strollers, although I informed them about it and showed them how it folds but they did not listen and they were unaware of this type of stroller. I purchased this type so that baggage handling dont break my stroller. They lost one of my baggage and I could not get it before the Eid. Even some cheap airlines gives food that is better than the food served in Emirates airlines and they served the same food in both flights although they were in different times. The seat size is ok but the quality of the touch screen can be improved. ",1,4th September 2018,Oman

740,"✅ Trip Verified |  Entebbe to Dubai. The ""worst experience"" as posted before from Rhianna Miller can still be topped! Not only did we have same problems with not working TVs generating heat - unbearable dryness - non-english announcements, no meaningful security briefing - a mini veggie lasagne handed over without a tray for a 6+ hour stay in the plane - a seat spacing which was meant for people under 160 cm only - back rests which could not recline at all, no pillows nor blankets. I booked Emirates (EK2447) for their service quality, and got this horror.",1,2nd September 2018,Austria
741,"✅ Trip Verified | Do not fly Emirates! I booked a first class ticket Singapore - Kuwait. I ran through several issues. First, as a first class passenger I was unable to change my flights online (I had to go through the inconvenience of visiting the nearest Emirates office to do that.) Is this for real? And you expect me to return as a first class passenger Emirates? Second, the service was horrible! Can you believe it took them over 20 minutes to prepare breakfast for me? When I asked for the cause of the delay they claimed that it took time to heat the meal. However, when I ran back to the galley to take sugar for my hot chocolate I found 5 or 6 cabin crew having a meal and chatting together rather than looking after their first class passengers. I do not think I would ever pay again for a first class ticket for Emirates, nor do I recommend any one to fly First Class with Emirates. Very bad tasted has been left in my mouth. No compensations offered.",5,1st September 2018,United States
742,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Beirut to San Francisco via Dubai. Not all of us can fly business across continents, and with the reviews I read on Emirates, I thought this would be the best option to travel to SFO in Economy. It's an A380 and the flight was extremely uncomfortable. Every inch was used and leg room was not considered, I am not a tall person! The food was below standards, and I can compare with many airlines, the cabin smelt unacceptable, over booked and way too many carryons to find a space for my own! I travel a lot and have experienced many airlines. It's a shame really that all this hype was for nothing. The A/C was visually clean, as were the restrooms, service was not too bad and the entertainment is what made me survive the flight. I was thoroughly disappointed, and will not be doing that again.",4,1st September 2018,Lebanon
743,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Dubai. I've noticed a drop in customer service over the years I've flown with Emirates and now it's going back up. This flight was the second leg of two flights to and from DXB and LGW. Service was exceptional, especially ground service. Service at Dubai on the first leg was and is never as good as London, but still very polite. Seats seemed comfortable, and tv screen was new. Service was very good onboard. Food was yummy lunch of sausage peas and mash potato, and the beverage cart came round once and I noticed that they were skipping rows with the drink cart. Duty-free shopping magazine was OK.

744,✅ Trip Verified | Two more great flights with Emirates from London to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 3 was quick and efficient and the lounge was marvellous especially for a plane spotter like myself. Boarding was smooth and a glass of nice Champagne offered before take-off. Staff were efficient and friendly and the food and wine offered were superb. Landed in Dubai and headed to lounge as the next flight to Melbourne departed at 2.20 am. Again a smooth boarding and even at that hour of the day a glass of bubbly was on offer and also the staff handed out hot towels and the mattress for the bed. Breakfast was promptly served and after a movie I slept for about 7 hours and then enjoyed a delicious lunch even though it was closer to dinner time at our destination. The multi national crew were fantastic. I usually ask where they come from and its almost like a mobile United Nations conference. Overall an outstanding pair of flights yet again and I really enjoy flying long haul with Emirates.,10,29th August 2018,Australia
745,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuwait to Lyon return via Dubai. I usually fly with Qatar Airways in Business class but they don't offer this route yet. I was terribly unsatisfied with Emirates product on these flights. First, the 2-3-2 configuration on their B777-300 is outdated and lacks comfort and privacy. The seats are old and screens often don't work properly. On my flight from Dubai to Kuwait, on the A380, my seat was not even clean and i found toothbrush protection on the cocktail table. Second, on my 4 flights during my trip, only 1 crew was attentive and nice to me. The others were not caring about passengers and were snobby and arrogant. Dinner is served on a tray and food not nicely presented (i'd call it economy in business). As for beverages (I usually drink wine during dinner), you can't expect it to be served after you finished your dinner. The crew were disorganized. Last, the internet on board was not working on any of the segments. I am totally disappointed in this airline which markets itself as one of the best. I'll definitely be flying other airline next time and be treated as a business class passenger.",1,28th August 2018,Kuwait
746,"✅ Trip Verified | Flown a total of 4 legs (Hamburg to Beijing via Dubai) with 36 persons together booked individually. Check In process was rather complicated because of pre-assigned seats but managed to pack the group together. Luggage drop off in Hamburg was very unfriendly and machine like by AHS staff with shouting throughout the terminal. But Emirates representative was very friendly and helpful with checking in 36 baggage pieces. Flight experience was superb. Several services were offered on all flights and asking for beverages in the galley was possible at all times. Paper menus were offered. Friendly and multi lingual cabin crew on all legs. Very caring for 5 ill kids throughout leg PEK-DXB. Greetings and good bye with not only professional smile. We were afraid of B777 10 abreast configuration - a bit tight but not cramped at all with 6'1"" height. Living space in A380 was superb. Partly bad reviews could not be verified using Emirates on those 4 legs.

747,"✅ Trip Verified | The service provided by Emirates on both the outbound and the inbound journeys far exceeds what is offered by other carriers flying transatlantic routes to Europe from the East Coast. Both flights left and arrived on time. On both outbound and inbound we were offered two full meals (breakfast on outbound could use improvement), hot towel service, high quality reusable amenity kits, free alcoholic drinks, mood lighting (including a unique 'starry sky' effect when the cabin was dark), and top notch in-flight entertainment which included live camera views from the front and bottom of the aircraft. Economy passengers were also offered free in-flight wi-fi up to a certain amount of megabytes (more than enough to instant message friends and family on the ground with travel updates). All of this for a price that was significantly lower that that of US and Europe based carriers.

I started flying Emirates airlines beginning of this year, I was able to upgrade my seat to business class through their promotions on both my trips to south-east Asia. When it is possible to do so, I will plan all my future airline travels through Emirates. The business class service is elegant, the cabin crew is professional and very efficient.  There was a variety of gourmet food options(but I did skip some of the meals as I was not hungry). I thoroughly enjoyed the traditional local Arabic mezze entree. Business class comes with other perks, like the fast track through security, which allowed me to avoid long lines.

751,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Male via Dubai. Disappointed. Somehow there is a myth that this is a great airline. Legroom is great as is the entertainment system. But with that all is said on the greatness. Flight delays are badly communicated (both to and from Dubai) and service is really poor. 2-2,5 hrs after take off you get served while having waited at the gate for 2 hrs (1,5 hrs delay) Cart is sitting in the aisle for 1,5 hrs before they start using it. No glass of water offered and on a six hour night flight you don’t wait for over two hours to serve drinks or meals. Crew not unfriendly but for far friendly. If I can avoid I won’t fly again.

I have experienced Emirates business class product a few times over the last year and few things have been consistent: poor menu, rushed service, unpersonalized service, rude and poorly trained cabin crew.

756,✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to London via Dubai. Early start with EK 409 departing Melbourne at 5.00 am so arrived at airport at 2.30 am to check in. Ground staff were great but warned me that immigration and security would not open until 3.00 am! As you can imagine with a full flight there were hundreds of passengers lined up to go through this process. Was given a priority lane pass which made the progress much easier. Boarding was prompt but could have stayed in the lounge as it had an excellent breakfast menu and great seating. On board was offered a glass of French which at 4.30 am is the only way to start the day. Seat was more than comfortable and the staff were first rate. Breakfast offering after take-off included a healthy option or the more traditional fare of bacon and eggs etc. The crew now use an electronic form on smart devices to take your order. Lunch was served 2 hours from landing and again an excellent choice. Landed on time and after 90 minutes it was off to London on EK 003. Again the crew were welcoming and drinks offered before take off and orders promptly taken when airborne. More food served before landing at London Heathrow and landing was right on time. On each flight passengers are offered a mattress to put on the seat and in some cases an extra pillow. ICE system is brilliant and a great selection to choose from and the cameras on the aircraft are a must watch for landing and take-off. Overall a fantastic long haul experience with friendly crew and great service. Could not recommend more highly.,10,15th August 2018,Australia
757,"Not Verified |  New York to Johannesburg via Dubai. I accompanied my teenage son to a short internship in a private conservation area in South Africa. He was tasked with photographing all the researchers operating in that area and therefore had to take expensive photographic gear. We showed that gear to the Emirates check-in manager in New York, who gave us no trouble at all for carrying it on as hand luggage. Leaving Johannesburg, Emirates agents stopped us and the manager treated us terribly, telling us that we couldn't take the gear on the plane, that it was a safety hazard, blah blah. Our checked luggage was very light so we were not over in terms of the weight we were bringing on the flight. He told us that our only option was to sign a liability form and put the lenses in the hold. We might as well have thrown the gear into the street and watched the trucks run over it. This was the day before Christmas, and the airline basically threw us out to find our own way home at holiday time -- even though they had allowed us to fly in. We got no refund. We had to buy same-day tickets home on Delta -- and by the way, our hand luggage did not come even close to falling out of the overhead storage on that airline.

760,"Not Verified |  Totally disappointed with Emirates on the flights from Manchester to Dubai, and from Dubai to Manchester on the way back. Flights to and from Singapore the cabin crew were very good but airplane was old and some of the touch screens were not working and also the seats were not very good. The experience at Manchester airport was horrendous- that wasn’t the airlines fault. Once we got onto plane the plane though the experience didn’t improve the stewards and stewardesses looked bored and could not be bothered with passengers. When they did come round it felt as though they were just completing jobs without a care as to how they do it! Also noticed that the kids meals were not presented as they used to be 2 years ago when I last traveled with them. Dubai to Manchester on the 31st of July- firstly flight we had booked was supposed to be from Singapore to Colombo and then to Dubai, they had overbooked and as a result offered us a direct flight from Singapore to Dubai which we didn’t have an issue with. Flight from Dubai was a different story the cabin staff looked depressed and really difficult to deal with. You would ask nicely but their responses were really short and every time it was a no! Having had 3 children with us they were given breakfast part of which was cereal, all 3 were given different cereals which caused problems as they all wanted the same one, when the air stewardess was asked if she could check if there was this particular cereal available her answer was no straight away without even checking. Overall we just feel as a family in future we would rather travel long haul with other airlines as Emirates service was terrible and reading reviews we don’t appear to be the only ones. Emirates have started offering a saver fare which if you book be aware you will not be able to pre select your seats. Inflight entertainment was some of the worst I had seen - some of the movies were really old! I think Emirates appear to have forgotten who they are competing against here, it appears they want to compete with budget airlines hence they are using their pricing tactics.

764,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Manila via Dubai. Here is an airline that has deteriorated in a spectacular fashion. I have flown with Emirates since the late 90's and had not used them recently. I decided to use them this year. What a shock! This was not the Emirates that I used to know and liked immensely. Their aircraft are dirty and their staff, both on the ground and in the air, are inept and downright rude. In my particular case, i originally booked flights from Gatwick to Manila, via a two hour stopover in Dubai. After paying for the flights, Emirates emailed me to say that the schedules had changed and I was now on a flight from Heathrow with a one hour stopover in Dubai. To be honest, i was somewhat wary of such a tight connection time but I (in hindsight) stupidly trusted Emirates to get me to my destination on time. Well, the inevitable happened. The flight from Heathrow was delayed, thus causing me to miss my connecting flight to Manila. Incidentally, having checked this particular flight (EK004), it appears that it has been late departing from Heathrow virtually every evening. I would love to know how many other Manila bound passengers have missed their connection in this way over the last three months. The Emirates ground crew at Dubai were next to useless, accommodating us in a shabby hotel in Dubai for a few hours and then sticking us on a Hong Kong bound flight that evening, to connect with a Philippine Airlines flight the following morning. In short, a planned 17 hour, 1 stop journey became a 30 hour, 2 stop journey. I contacted Emirates and asked why we had not been placed on the direct flight from Dubai to Manila that evening. We would have still been late, but at least we would not have had to connect in Hong Kong. As yet, no answer. In fact, the response from Emirates has been condescending and wholly unsatisfactory. The Dubai ground crew and the Emirates customer service office give the impression that they are doing the delayed passengers a huge favour by shipping them out on a little bus to a Dubai hotel for a few hours and then placing them on later, non-direct flights. The customer services rep in his email to me even had the brass neck to point out how expensive it is for Emirates to re-book us on to another airline at Hong Kong.  Here's an idea Emirates, stop re-scheduling passengers on to flights with almost impossible connection times and get your passengers to their destinations as advertised. In conclusion, we missed a late evening meet up with friends in Manila and I had to fork out £160 for new internal flights to our final destination, as we had missed our original flights in Manila. Any potential Emirates passengers out there, read these reviews and take heed. Avoid the headaches and book with an airline who actually know what they are doing. I certainly shall in future.",10,9th August 2018,United Kingdom
765,"✅ Trip Verified |  We booked a connecting flight from London to Dar es Salaam via Dubai. Due to bad weather in Europe our plane was late departing and we spent over two hours on the runway. Consequently we missed our connecting flight in Dubai. When we finally reached Dubai there was complete chaos. There were 200+ other people who also missed connections and it was not clear where to go. We followed the crowd to the desk area for help there were only 4 Emirates staff helping over 200 people get to their final destinations. We were trying to get to Dar Es Salaam in Tanzania to meet a further connecting flight to start a 5 night safari. After after about a 45 minute wait we eventually got to speak to someone who said we could get an 8 hour flight to Johannesburg then a further flight to back to Dar Es Salaam. This would mean we would have got to Dar Es Salaam too late to catch our final connection and would have missed two days of our safari. Out of a 5 night safari this is a significant portion. When I complained I was told to stop wasting his time. Other people were also being badly treated. One other passenger found a replacement flight online and asked to be transferred but was told you've got your ticket don't speak to me anymore. Bearing in mind Emirates knew early on that the plane would be delayed they had over 8 hours to sort this out what they came up with was completely inadequate. It seemed everyone was being sent to Johannesburg. As the flight to Johannesburg was 4am the next morning we were sent to a hotel to wait. When we got to the hotel there were hundreds of other people waiting to check in as well. We queued in reception for over 3 hours to get our room but I'm not sure why we bothered as we had no luggage as this was still at the airport. Thankfully our tour operator Audley Travel managed to book us onto a flight to Zanzibar and then onto Dar Es Salaam in time to meet our final connection and only miss 1 day of our holiday and not 2. The flight to Zanzibar was with FlyDubai which is owned by the same people as Emirates. Why couldn't we have been offered this option by Emirates? You would hope this was the end of our bad experience with Emirates but no. When we went to come home we turned up at the airport in Dar Es Salaam over 3 hours before our flight was due to leave but were told by the check in staff that they could not print our boarding passes. The reason for this is because our tickets were out of sequence. It seems you have have to go wherever Emirates wish to send you in this case Johannesburg regardless of wether you wish to go there or not. We spent a further three hours at the airport in Dar Es Salaam not knowing if we would be able to go home. They said it was a security issue but they could clearly see our passports, they could see when we arrived in Tanzania as our visa was stamped with the date of arrival and they would have known our luggage had been transferred to a different flight. Only thanks to the persistence of the check in manager at Dar Es Salaam who spent over 2 hours on the phone and the immigration officials who sped us through security did we make the flight back home with only 2 minutes to spare. All in all I would definitely not recommend Emirates as an airline. It seems they can only run an airline if things run smoothly but are completely out of there depth if they hit a problem. The mark if a good company is how they deal with things when problems arise and in my view they completely failed",1,8th August 2018,United Kingdom
766,"✅ Trip Verified |  Durban to Athens via Dubai. Emirates standards have dropped considerably. They don’t even have the food which they are offering on the menu, the menu offers a choice but when you choose the fish they say they don’t have. On this particular flight they even admitted they had hardly any of the fish option. On the next flight my wife was lucky enough to score the last chicken meal and I was forced to accept the beef. Also, the food was generally bland and I would hazard a guess they have changed caterers. They have also cut a few corners in the meal, for example the little chocolate has disappeared. They also didn’t offer the usual overnight packs (tooth brush, eye thingy etc)...when I enquired about this I was told they only offer these on flights exceeding 9 hours and the first leg of our flight was about 8 hours. This must be a new policy, as we have always received these packs.

769,✅ Trip Verified |  Los Angeles to Mumbai via Dubai. Food service on flight from Los Angeles to Dubai and return was one meal in second hour of flight and one pizza slice 2 hours before landing. This is what we were served on a 16 hour flight - they served soft drinks/juice and wine and alcohol 45 minutes after the first meal was served. Alcohol/wine is generally served 30 minutes prior to food service. The Dubai terminal was resembling a fish market. There were approx 120 seats near the gate. They are using A380-800 which is 475 to 500 passengers on a flight. The number of seats were totally inadequate. The staff serves food and drinks - but when you ask for something they dont have like Diet Coke/Diet Pepsi they say 'sir I have apple juice/orange juice' - They want passenger to believe they do not have Diet coke/diet pepsi. They are not willing to walk a bit and get the diet coke from the pantry for the passenger. Movies/TV shows were in large quantity but lacked quality. The staff do not clean the toilets on a 16 hour flight. This is not a premium airline - this resembles a budget airline.,1,3rd August 2018,United States

771,"✅ Trip Verified |  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai. At the recommendation of the cruise company we booked with, who said they receive a very good deal with Emirates we had them book our flights. Prior to leaving we phoned Emirates to arrange seat allocations, after this was done we were informed that we were to be charged an extra $200AUD for this booking. After complaining to the cruise company they did pay this cost. This is the first time we have ever had to pay for booking seat allocations on any airline we have travelled on overseas. As my wife has a medical condition that prevents her from eating anything spicy we checked out the food options with Emirates and their representative was very understanding and recommended that the best option was a Western Vegan Meal, this was confirmed in a email from them. On the flight to Dubai/ Rome WHAT happens, my wife's meal arrives and if not the sauces then whether the fish,chicken,beef or pork all come out with curry in it. Regardless of complaints no other option available, no spare standard meal either. However, on the Dubai to Rome section when the same meal problem arose the cabin crew supervisor asked us for our flight details and said she would arrange to cancel this ""vegan"" meal option and it would mean my wife would have the choice of the regular meals on our return flights home from Barcelona. Somewhere in cyberspace this arrangement still lingers, for on our flight from Barcelona history repeated itself. Once again, No spare meals available so as before my wife had a whatever I could give her off mine, likewise the same issue came up on the flight from Dubai to Melbourne. Just to add insult to injury, as we were seated near the galley we saw meal trays dropped on the floor and the noise coming from there was loud to say the least, also we feel the toilets could have been more regularly checked as the basins needed cleaning and toilet rolls replaced as well as refuse bins emptied. Seated next to me was a young man with a liking for gin and tonics, He was seen ordering ""doubles "" e.g. two bottles at a time and also helping himself to the bar which was parked behind our seats. Added to this he decided it was more comfortable to squat on the seat with his posterior almost on the headrest of the seat. Of course what happened next was predictable, a full drink spilled all over me, so with using our blankets to clean up this mess and dry me off we needed two clean blankets. Request for same met with the reply that no spare blankets available, which meant we spent the rest of the flight cold no thanks to the air-con. However, just before arrival a flight attendant was seen collecting unused blankets and passed us with a large bag three quarters full of unused blankets, two of which I am sure could have been found with a little effort so we didn't go cold. Needless to say we will never fly Emirates again nor recommend them to anyone.",1,30th July 2018,Australia

The flight attendant gave us the excuse that other people probably put them there, but never apologized (Aranza). We understand that we did not pay for “first class”, but that does not mean we should be treated any less. How does an airline not pack enough food for a 12 hour and 45 minute flight? Please help me understand.  It has taken years for a company to build its reputation, but seconds to destroy it! We were highly disappointed and I will be sure to never fly with Emirates ever again and will never recommend your airline! They do not project themselves to what they make it seem.",6,25th July 2018,United States
775,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Jakarta via Dubai. All flights with the customer service, seats food, entertainment etc was good, but the onboard staff service looks inexperienced which is the only negative things. There is no chaos onboard but the crew expected to not help passenger if they need help. Then when I press the button then the crew told wait but 10 minutes called another staff but not at all. The good thing about this airline is the service has been improving since the last time I've flown with them few years ago. The shocking is about the staff service onboard which ignores the passengers. ",9,24th July 2018,South Africa
776,✅ Trip Verified |  Athens to Christchurch via Dubai. I booked tickets 6 months ago and found that I couldn't select seats on our homeward flights from Athens to Christchurch.

777,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Ho chi Minh City. My baggage was missing. When I reached the destination, I was informed and I was on official tour. The suggestion I received from the incompetent staff was “your baggage can only come after 36 hours. You can trying buying clothes from there”. They have no understanding of customer needs. Leaving baggage is a practice they love. My baggage went missing again in July in another flight. Traveling through Emirates is just waste of money, time, and all you get is frustration.

778,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had a bad experience with Emirates customer service before in the past and it didn't change. I thought this was a good airline and happily purchased an unaccompanied minor ticket for my son which was expensive already at over 1700$. I gave all required information for pick up etc. to the airline and they assured me that they have all info. Unfortunately, on my sons flying date they needed more info (which they never informed me about) and tried to call me but never reached me and just didn't board my son. The next day I complained about this treatment and was forced to pay another 500$ to no fault of mine. They said I could get the money back through customer service. I did complain and stated my case but I only received an unfriendly rejection. Therefore this ticket cost me 2300$ which is higher than any other airline. In addition, my sons next day flight got delayed so that he missed the connection in Dubai due to Emirates fault. He had to spend the night at the airport to finally arrive another day later! This unprofessional treatment with poor customer service and delays is unacceptable. Last year I used Lufthansa with my son and no surprises/ unfair increase of rates/ no delays/ no problems- What a difference! ",5,19th July 2018,Saudi Arabia

Will not use this airline again.",1,16th July 2018,United Kingdom
780,✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Dubai. I think Emirates is losing the plot. Service average at best. And for the second time in two weeks an A380 with around 450 passengers parked remotely. So around 10-12 busses sent on a 25 minute drive around the airport to reach the terminal. Very ordinary experience. Qatar Airways seems to win the war of the middle eastern carriers.

I was upgraded to business class from Dubai to Sao Paulo (A380) and the service was  excellent: comfortable flat-bed seat, very good meals, cabin crew very kind and helpful, great in-flight entertainment.

783,"✅ Trip Verified |  I can’t describe how upset I am by being stuck on Fl Dubai plane for 5 hours with no food, drink, in-flight entertainment or internet. I did book Moscow to Hanoi via Dubai  specifically to fly with Emirates, that cost me 650USD one way, compared to Aeroflot 650USD/round trip which is direct, modern and safe anyway. I paid twice as much just to have an experience with Emirates. Instead of Emirates plane I found myself in an outdated shabby unsafe little aircraft. I never been send to a low-cost instead of a full service. How is that even possible a company like Emirates co-shares with a lower cost. By co-sharing I mean they stuck me on a lower cost, send one meal, 1 cup of free water and let me carry 30kg of luggage. There was no choice of food and the suggested free dinner, only one option, was not suitable for me, no free snacks available no nothing. I had to buy water and peanuts. I booked a ticket with Emirates for my husband London-Dubai-Hanoi round trip and he had an amazing flight despite his flight was longer and the price was cheaper. I don’t book planes which sell water and sandwiches and I would never in a conscious mind choose Fly Dubai for a 5 hours flight, seats were uncomfortable even for my 5 feet. It was freezing cold the entire time and no blankets available, I couldn’t even hear the announcement it was just cracking noise. The whole experience felt like a charter flight in 90s, I never saw flight attendants just sleeping on the back row on a 5 hours flight before, our departure was also delayed because of late arrival. I couldn’t even charge my phone up to 60% in 5 hours, the equipment was that old! I have noticed that my flight is operated by FlyDubai on behalf of Emirates on my ticket but I have no idea what FlyDubai is and didn’t expect such a con being pulled off by Emirates. FlyDubai is not the same level as Emirates, if I wanted to fly with FlyDubai, in my case Emirates is a middle-man profiting by using the brand to sell cheap flights at high price.  I complained to the customer service afterwards but they just blamed me on not researching what FlyDubai is. So I guess they are aware of what they are doing but hope that people will be just tricked and book a ticket because of Emirates brand on it. Second flight Dubai-Hanoi was also pretty awful, just got a sandwich, croissant and an omelette in 7 hours flight, was pretty uneatable, the plane was very shabby as well. And at the check-in Emirates even tried to put me on standby because the plane was overbooked, even though I paid for my tickets 2 months in advance. guess Emirates don’t care about their customers as much as they did.",7,12th July 2018,Vietnam
784,✅ Trip Verified |  Auckland to Birmingham via Brisbane / Dubai. The B777 on the Brisbane to Dubai leg was cramped and dirty. The A380 on the Dubai-Birmingham leg had more leg room. It was A380s on the return journey to Melbourne. Having heard people rate Emirates I was so disappointed. Each flight was late (by about an hour each time) departing. The cabin service was poor. We were offered one alcoholic drink for the whole of a 14 hour flight. The food was so salty as to be inedible and being on a special diet for medical reasons I couldn't eat anything that the airports offered. If the baggage locker over your seat row was full you had to find space somewhere else which could be several rows back. The cabin crew refused to help. So no I never want to use this airline again. And I don't recommend them.,1,12th July 2018,New Zealand
785,"✅ Trip Verified |  Santiago to Sao Paulo. After my original flight from Latam being cancelled last minute (without an explanation from either branch in both countries until the next day after the flight would have left, I was forced to book a last minute (6 days in advance) cheapest flight I could find out of the country. I came across Emirates and booked a direct, roundtrip flight from Santiago to Sao Paulo for over $800. When arriving at my gate and waiting for my flight, my flight information was not up on the screen when it was supposed to be boarding. It said the UAE flight with whatever number (which, i guess in their defense was the same number as my EK flight) heading to Dubai was posted. confused, I looked at the screen of all the departing flights and mine was not mentioned. Remember, I was going to Sao Paulo, Brazil, not Dubai, UAE. I went up the workers at the Dubai counter asking them if they knew where my flight got cancelled since it would have been the same company. They said that was the same flight. The screen only said Dubai and had a different flight code. I never would have known that was my flight. We asked the workers several times to clarify that we were going to be getting off in Brazil since if they were wrong we would end up on the other side of the world. They confirmed again. I will compliment them on their politeness and calmness as I was definitely not very calm with them. Nowhere on the website, the check in online, my ticket, with the bag drop employee, or anywhere /one was it mentioned that the final destination was Dubai and Sao Paulo was just a stop over. Of course, when we were about the depart they were having brake issues for an hour, as well. Everything worked out in the end thankfully and they did serve a generous amount of food. But I would suggest posting (or at least notifying) passengers at least once of both / all destinations. I question now whether my flight was so expensive because of the additional destination that flight had and I feel slightly cheated. I don't recommend flying with them without speaking to them about all of the details of your flight.",1,10th July 2018,United States
786,"✅ Trip Verified |  Maldives to Boston via Dubai. All I can say this was the first time I had traveled on Emirates. As much as I have heard of this airline, this was the worst decision. With 12hrs flight haul, it is understandable that the trip will be not very comfortable. But, with the crew on board that cannot get you water until to press the button on you seat 10 times and finally they get annoyed by the pings and decide to come ask you how they can help. As one attendant told me we are out of ice. just seconds later asked a different crew member they got me some ice.

While booking my flight to go home, I couldn't do it on this occasion. Note that this was my first time on Emirates. I checked the website and all it gave was the menu and nothing else. Apparently, I should have given them a call and told them what I wanted for a meal but it didn't say so anywhere. It turns out that I was given fish to eat which i did, not knowing what it was. And when i raised a complaint with Emirates a couple months later, they blamed me saying I should have called them to say so. Nowhere was the instruction given that I need to do that. How am I supposed to know? During the flight, when I got a second meal, that's when I asked and they changed my meal, not even apologizing for the mistake they made.

792,"✅ Trip Verified |  Rome to Dubai. An excellent flight on Emirates. Boarding at FCO on the A380 now faster, smoother thanks to the new departure gate at FCO with dual level air stairs. Nice welcome on board by smiling, professional crew. Took off 30 mins late due to late arrival of the inbound aircraft (due, no doubt, to delays at DXB during the morning departure rush between 07.30 - 10.00) but time was made up and we later landed on schedule. Someone says on earlier report that EK doesn't ask for feedback? There's a digital survey card contained within ICE or you can report your comments to one of the cabin supervisors. I did this as I wanted to comment on the fact that EK no longer offers a pre-lunch drinks service on this route instead combining the meal and cocktail service together. I understand why this is - some people want to eat as soon as they sit down - but it does make the initial part of the cabin service rather rushed, which is unnecessary on a 5.5 hour flight. In the past on this route ice cream was served about 4 hours into the flight but this has now been replaced with a sandwich and tea / coffee. Lunch, incidentally, was excellent (braised beef, gratin potatoes and the most delicious crumble for dessert), and I write that as someone who doesn't usually take the meal on this sector. Being extra picky here but it's a shame Campari is no longer offered as a cocktail in economy but good to note there was a selection of three different types of red wine. Everyone knows the ICE entertainment system is absolutely superb and caters for all nationalities / languages, I often watch Italian or French movies. This time, it even included live World Cup football. And the economy seats on EK's A380s are so comfortable and spacious.

The seat is of average space, but your space will be highly deprived when the front seat reclined. The TV appears to be too bright and it hurts the eyes. I could not watch the flight information on some of the flights. The thing that I am most furious is about the online system of Emirates. The website lags and you have very few choice in online check in as all passengers are pre-allocated a seat before check in. Finally, transit in Dubai Airport is a disaster that you could hardly find a way and it seems to be messy. Fortunately, cabin crew speak fluent English and they are international.",4,3rd July 2018,Hong Kong

Big rush to get from AKL intl. to domestic terminal but ongoing flight delayed for over 5 hours, no plane! The return journey was delayed at AKL by 6 hours due to tropical storm so missed connection to Gatwickat Dubai. Re routed to LHr via Rome.

795,"Not Verified |  London to Adelaide via Dubai / Brisbane. I am very surprised that huge airlines like Emirates do not ask you to review them after your flight. Do they not want to know about problems or have feedback? Obviously not. I heard it was rated best airline but by whom? I have travelled with them and other large airlines but not been asked to vote for them good or bad. Well I review them as bad. It is not made clear during booking how much seat allocation is going to cost you until after you have paid for your flight (apparently hidden somewhere in the smallprint) You should have the opportunity DURING the booking process to add your chosen seats then you would not have to add them on extra later. I paid £180 for return flight for me and my child to sit together. That was just allocating the two cheapest seats together. The flights were £1500+. They told me I could book 2 seats together within 48 hours of flying for free if there were any left - thats if. The airport terminal in Dubai is enormous and we only just made it to the gate for the next leg on time. They need longer on the ground before next flight. Myself and my son, the people to my side that I could see clearly did not eat the food apart from scones. The green sausages looked like plasticine. The white sausages again looked and tasted of plasticine. It states clearly on the website all children travelling will be allocated child meals automatically 24 hours before travel. They do not. If I wanted my child to have child meals I had to personally phone on all 4 legs of the journey to book each one. It is not available to do this online, but meals like kosher and vegetarian are! Ridiculous. And when we boarded, after an hour of take off my son was really thirsty so pressed the bell for water - it took over 40 minutes for him to be attended and the people behind me kept pressing too but nobody came to them either.

Once we arrived in Dubai since I’m a resident I was at the luggage belt in less than 5 mins and in 20 mins I was in the taxi on my way home.

As all other airlines do we thought that a group of flight attendants wold escort us to the new gate to catch the next flight, we also informed the flight attendants in our flight from Cyprus to Dubai to do so and they ensured us that this was going to be done and nothing to worry about. We needed to reach Singapore the following morning as we had a very important meeting arranged at the airport. However coming out the aisle none called our names and none would answer our questions on how to reach the next gate. They would only tell us that we missed the next flight as well and that there is no chance of us arriving on time to the gate to get the next one. After a lot of drama with the useless connection manager we lost a lot of valuable time with result of missing the next flight as well. It was simply horrible. Never experienced worse service in my life, not even with a budget airline. After arranging to stay in Dubai in order to have our meeting online we realized that we got an email from the airline that they rescheduled our seats for the following flight, and we could have made it on time if we saw the email earlier and not listed to the negative outcome from the unhelpful ''manager''.

I had a hard time getting a drink then was offered bourbon when I had ordered scotch. I didn't drink it and after many hours they took it away. Much later in flight, male flight attendant argued with me that the drink had been scotch not bourbon.

I was wheelchair bound and when I arrived at the check in at Melbourne all seemed fine... until I have been taken 3 hours before my flight to the gate, gate 11 empty, alone and abandoned there. No water no one to ask for help no chance to go to a toilet as I needed assistance. When finally an attendant arrived to open the gate, I asked her if I could have a glass of water and needed a toilet she said there was none around and I had to go to another area. I was boarded and kindly a flight attendant on the plane helped me to the toilet and gave me a glass of water. She felt terrible for what I experienced but could not do much about it. She tried to make a sort of a stool with a bag to make me stretch my leg. When arrived in Dubai they told me I had to go to the service desk and tell them what happened. The guy in Dubai who took me on my wheelchair, instead, left me for a while “parked” while he was happily chatting with other friends until I waved to get his attention and asked again to be taken to the service desk. Finally at service desk I explained the situation and what I had endured in Melbourne. They said they would take me to the lounge to wait. The guy brought me to another plane where I was left, and almost missed my flight to Venice! When I received an alert from Emirates to go straight to the gate I tried to get attention again!!)!  Arrived at the gate they changed  my seat. Previously I had a seat with empty ones right and left to allow me to raise my leg and stretch it on other and I thought the change was similar. Instead they moved me to seats whose armrest was fixed and could not be lifted making it impossible for my leg to rest flat on the other seats. ",9,15th June 2018,Australia
805,"✅ Trip Verified |  Venice to Melbourne via Dubai. I am now on my way back to Australia and yet again experiencing the worst customer service ever from Emirates. Just before my departure I had received an offer to upgrade from economy to business for part of my return trip from Dubai to Melbourne for AU$ 1157 . As my leg had not yet healed ( did my way into Europe on a wheelchair) and although feeling much better, I thought I could do this effort and upgrade so that I could be more comfortable. Before my departure I tried several times to do the online upgrade but unsuccessfully, as every time i filled everything and clicked “upgrade” a message came out that “the system was down”! (Note that my card was more than capable of covering the cost hence it was not a payment issue ) Tried again before I had to catch my first flight but then I had to board and had to let go. Arrived in Dubai I went to the service desk where there was only single person available to do the ticketing service and was stuck serving a person for over 20 minutes! I had another person before me and I knew I would never had time to wait so I went to another side of the service desk to ask for assistance. The lady said no one else could assist and also that she knew for sure I could not upgrade with that offer anymore as I had already started the first leg. When I explained that I did try many times to do the upgrade online before my flight but the Emirates website did not work and a message came out that the system was down (so it was not my fault) they just said they could not do anything and if I wanted to upgrade the price would not have been the same! On the plane I asked again. They had quite a few empty seats in business but they asked almost 4 times as much as the offer I had in my email (asked around 3.500 US dollars for one leg upgrade on the plane! While my offer was 1157 Australian dollars for the same which equals to us$ 864) I am so angry and disappointed but, if you want to see this from a marketing point of view Emirates has lost both in image and in money. In fact those seats have remained empty and Emirates has now another very upset and angry customer who has been loyal for years. Emirates has gone so downhill lately which is unbelievable.",10,15th June 2018,Australia

The flight to Dubai on a B777 was pleasant, with a comfortable seat which had adequate storage, and excellent food. The service was efficient but rather formal. The IFE on this flight was quite clunky. At Dubai we were bussed to the terminal, but as there was a dedicated Business Class bus this process was quite painless. Both the terminal itself and the Emirates lounge were very busy just after midnight. The second flight on an A380 was a big step up in luxury, with a more spacious seat, much more storage, more friendly cabin crew and very smooth IFE.

The seat in First remains awkward. To me, Emirates are outstanding for route network, lounges services and catering, website booking/managing, chauffeur pickup, seat comfort, onboard wifi, crews, and of course their unique ICE inflight entertainment. Where Emirates do not get their act together however, is for inflight catering, which remains surprisingly awful also in First. I always eat at the airport before my flight.

My luggage was weighed by Emirates staff (One cabin bag and a laptop bag) and I was passed through. At next stage a female staff informed that I couldn't carry my cabin luggage as there is not much space inside the flight and I will need to Check-it in. I requested to carry it inside and explained it had original property documents which were very important and I couldn't check it in (I even opened my bag and showed her that there were only the documents). While I was talking to her the Supervisor came to me, grabbed my luggage in very rude manner and took luggage back to weighing place and told I am not allowed to take a laptop bag. I explained that it is mentioned on my tickets that one carry-on item such as laptop is allowed. He said your other bag is heavier than allowed limit and I will need to pay the money for that. I told it was already passed from Washington Airport as well as here (Dubai) also. It looked like that other staff there was also not comfortable with his behavior.  Finally I requested him to let me go and I will pay the additional charge. After a lot of request and paying the amount he allowed me and told the staff to check in my luggage and didn't allow in the flight.",1,10th June 2018,United States
810,✅ Trip Verified |  Jakarta to Moscow via Dubai. Emirates ruined my vacation. Had a really awful experience with Emirates. On our way back from Jakarta to Dubai our flight was cancelled and Emirates never notified us. As a result we showed up on time of our original flight only to find out that Emirates moved us to an earlier flight without notifying us. Emirates refused to sit us on another flight and we had to buy new tickets back home all the way from Jakarta to Moscow. Even after that incident for 3 months already I’m struggling to get a confirmation that my flight was cancelled to get a compensation from my travel insurance company. And for 3 months I encounter the heaviest bureaucracy I’ve seen in years. And zero result. Never again I will fly with Emirates.,8,7th June 2018,Russian Federation
811,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to London via Dubai. We have experienced first-hand how high-handed Emirates has become lately. We are told to check-in our carry-on luggage at the gate just before entering the flight in Hyderabad en route to LHR via Dubai. Once we reached LHR one of the checked carry-on bag went missing. We got our bag finally after 3 days of minimal communication from Emirates, only to find out our laptop got stolen along with other food items. Emirates did not inform us about missing stuff when the bag got delivered. Their customer service  responses were canned and totally put the blame on us for checking in the bag. Such a shame! ",4,1st June 2018,India
812,"✅ Trip Verified |  Flew Dubai to Lisbon. If you are looking for a comfortable seat, don’t fly Emirates. The seats were in very bad shape and had almost zero padding. Furthermore, despite paying quite a substantial amount for the exit row seats to ensure we had extra legroom, on the Dubai to Lisbon leg, the space we paid for was constantly filled by passengers queuing up to have their photographs taken with Emirates service staff. This practice, which appeared to be encouraged by Emirates staff, resulted in great inconvenience to ourselves and many other passengers. The choice of entertainment was also below par.",2,31st May 2018,Australia
813,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Durban via Dubai. I upgraded with miles to business class on both legs and qualified for the chauffeur drive at both ends. Business class is something Emirates does extremely well and the A380 business class product in particular is outstanding. B777-300ER still good but a 2-3-2 layour (instead of the 1-2-1 on the A380), seats don't lie 180 degrees flat and no personal work space/minibar. Attention from cabin staff, food etc great. Lounge at Dubai was in one of the smaller terminals so not as good as the main business class lounge but connection was short anyway. Overall well worth the miles upgrade",2,31st May 2018,United Kingdom
814,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates in May 2018. It was genuinely a disappointing trip and  confirmed just how overrated Emirates is. On the AMS-DXB sector, every Cabin Crew member genuinely looked like they did not want to be there. People would move out of their way in the aisle to make way for the crew and were never given a single smile or ""thank you"" of acknowledgement. They were far from friendly, could not crack a smile, and appeared like emotionless robots. The seats were so uncomfortable and you could feel the framework of them beneath your behind because the seats had been sat in so many thousands of times without re-upholstering. That's not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. The entertainment system was a joke. Please don't get me started on it. On not one, but both sectors, there was no recognition in their system that I had requested a vegetarian meal, so I was lucky to be graced with ""untouched leftover"" vegetarian meals on both sectors, but only for one meal on each flight. The Cabin Crew on the first flight couldn't stop reminding me how lucky I was and that it was my fault and patronised me, repeatedly saying ""mmm yes, just next time you must request your meal beforehand."" They seemed to have not listened to a word I said. Regardless, there was not even a vegetarian option on the actual menu. ",2,26th May 2018,Australia
815,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first experience with Emirates, and I was surprised how average it was. Maybe expectations were too high, but this experience was just not as good as Emirates promotes itself (best airline? Really?) The aircraft was not new and a few seats were damaged. The cabin was not clean. The staff were not friendly, and once they totally ignored my request for assistance. Entertainment system was not very handy: the touchscreen was not working properly on both flights, so I had to use an old and an uncomfortable joystick. I didn't like the selection of movies, either - there were many movies in the database (including Asian, Bollywood etc) but all of the Western movies were more or less of the same genre. Same with TV shows. The dinner was very good, however, only one real meal on a long haul flight was not sufficient (only an old sandwich was given before landing). There were no snacks or beverages in between. No amenity kits provided. There was wifi onboard; 2 hours free. On a positive note, you can check-in 2 bags, 32 kg each. Overall, it was all okay because Emirates flight was the cheapest one among all flights available for this route and date. I would be very disapointed otherwise, though.",8,24th May 2018,Italy
816,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. This was truly a flight to remember. The seat went beyond comfortable; it was luxurious. This was a short flight, so my interest in the IFE was limited to the flight map and the external cameras - what a treat! There were so many flight attendants assigned to the business cabin that the service was personalized and super attentive. Once again, I enjoyed the lounge food so much that I had little appetite left for the elaborate onboard meal. I ordered the ""mild"" chicken curry. I should known that my interpretation of mild and that of the Thai catering service might vary considerably. I had contacted Emirates customer service ahead of the flight with a special request. Their communication was exemplary, and they accommodated me beyond what I Had hoped for. The only drawback to this flight that I can comment upon is that it has spoiled me for flying with anyone else. I will have to adjust my expectations.",8,23rd May 2018,United States
817,✅ Trip Verified | From the Emirates lounge in Glasgow all the way to Adelaide everything worked well. The flights were good and the transit in Dubai was fine. The first flight had excellent service whilst the flight to Adelaide the staff weren't as attentive. Good airline and I would use them again.,5,21st May 2018,United Kingdom
818,✅ Trip Verified |  Dallas to Dhaka via Dubai. Nightmare in the Sky! Horrible Experience! The flight from USA to Dubai was a chaos! They have messed up the seating arrangement for most of the passengers. They changed my assigned seat. It was an aisle seat but they changed it to a middle seat. And again changed it back as I complained after boarding the aircraft. The interior of the aircraft looked old and not clean. The worst part was food. Chicken/prawn curry with rice. These were my options and I choose chicken curry.  Snack was a small pizza which was a joke. I was hungry for the whole duration of the flight. The ticket was expensive so it was surely not a value for money.  It used to be good but now it is a hell in the sky if you have a long flight. Never again.,1,19th May 2018,United States
819,"✅ Trip Verified | Hong Kong to Bangkok. Departure delayed by an hour due to a technical fault which could not be fixed with another Emirates A380 due to fly HKG non-stop to DXB three hours 25 minutes earlier. Some passengers from that flight were transferred to ours. But why that should have resulted in a lengthy delay to our flight beats me and was never explained. As a result we had to sit on board for over an hour before push-back. Once again I found the revised upper deck layout with 100 or so Y passengers in front of business class especially annoying, this time with what seemed like a major raucous party taking place just a few rows in front of my seat. Having travelled for much of the day and connected in HKG, I found it impossible to relax, the more so as the plane was being refuelled and the lighting full on. How come refuelling took place after the scheduled departure time given that our aircraft had arrived in HKG several hours earlier? Although hungry, I skipped dinner as midnight was just too late for me. All I wanted was try and sleep but even that was difficult with the short flight time. I appreciate that technical issues do occur and I felt sorry for those who had to be involuntarily rerouted via BKK and would as a result arrive late in DXB by six hours or more. For those of us who had elected to take the Bangkok flight, though, this was maddening! The lack of detailed explanations was even more so.",1,18th May 2018,Thailand
820,"✅ Trip Verified |  Munich to Jakarta via Dubai. The quality and service with Emirates has gone downhill within years. Upon arrival in Munich, I am informed that one of the seats in the A380 is damaged and been told to change the seat. In addition to that, customer ignored the seating requested. The seat is damaged was located in the window seat and only middle seat available, because it is a full flight. Never experience like this before on other airline. The first food was edible and the second one (before landing) was awful. The entertainment on my seat was broken, asking staff for help but ignored this helped. The WI-FI is free for several minutes but you must pay again after that. Last leg on DXB-CGK this is at least better than the MUC-DXB route which everything works fine. The service on the A380 was unacceptable with lack of customer support who decides on changing seat for the customers that flies the A380. In the future, I will avoid their A380 because of this issues with IFE etc. I have sent complaint to the airline which I’m still waiting for any replies about this experience.",1,16th May 2018,Indonesia
821,✅ Trip Verified | My flight on the outward journey and inward journey was late and we had to run the length of Dubai airport to catch our connecting flight. Dubai airport is huge and my husband has trouble walking let alone running. Cabin crew on return flight from Dubai to Manchester were dreadful. We were 3 and a half hours before a drink was offered but we could clearly see the staff in the galley eating and drinking and have a good old laugh. They said nothing when a man walked up the aisle cleaning his teeth with toothpaste and a brush with disgusting bits flying over the other passengers. A horrible experience from start to finish.,2,13th May 2018,United Kingdom
822,"✅ Trip Verified | Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai. First flight, on time boarding done very efficiently due to empty flight. Crew were very nice telling passengers sat in full rows that there were free rows scattered around the plane that they could move to. Plane was brand new, great seats, great entertainment system. Food was 50/50. On time arrival into Dubai but delayed due to having to go to a remote stand and taking a bus that took 40 minutes! to get to the terminal. Got to the terminal and realised I left my onwards boarding pass on the plane but the staff issued me a new one very quickly. Second flight boarded on time as well however, we were an hour late taking off due to the weather but the crew made up for it. Like the first flight, crew were excellent and the food was a lot better on the 2nd leg. Sat on the upper deck, definitely recommend it as the more private cabin and the side compartments are really good. Overall, great experience with Emirates.",9,13th May 2018,United Kingdom
823,"✅ Trip Verified |  I had prepurchased a seat for extra legroom, but the layout didnt state that the seat is next to the staff kitchen/pantry. And because of this, I receive constant noises and laughter from the staff, even when the public lights are off, waking me up at several times. That's not all, I had paid for extra legroom, but people are constantly knocking my long stretch legs over, causing me to retract my legs all the time. Hence, the irony of purchasing an extra legroom when in fact, I don't get any throughout the flight. To make things worst, there are 2 staff seats opposite our seats, so during landing and take off, 2 staff will be sitting there. And because they are sitting there, I have to retract my  legs again. I'd paid for extra legroom, but in the end, it was a terrible experience. Never again am I going to prepurchase a legroom at the sides of the plane, especially from Emirates. Terrible experience. As for the other experiences, most of the crew were ok, they will serve and do their job, but lack the smile on their face. Not that they look rude or unhappy, it's just not the expression you will receive in flights like Singapore Air. Inflight entertainment was good, great contents, but the touchscreen was terrible. Touchscreen is based on a mouse cursor on screen. If you touch a particular button, you need to do it a few times so that the cursor will understand that it should be at your thumb. Hence, a difficult screen to control.",1,10th May 2018,Singapore
824,✅ Trip Verified | Auckland to London via Dubai. First time to fly on Emirates and was expecting excellent service for a big airline fleet. I was disappointed. The flight attendants seemed unhappy and unenthusiastic with what they are doing. They seemed robotic and lacked human compassion that I’ve experienced with other airlines. The seats are cramped with little leg room that I couldn’t even get pass (seated on the window side) without having to wake the sleeping person next to me. I know that economy class isn’t really first class service but I had the best time flying with Qantas!,5,8th May 2018,United Kingdom
825,"✅ Trip Verified |  We flew from London to Manila via Dubai and back. Boarding wasn't stressful. Legroom was good and the seats had a good recline. It was enough for me to sleep when I needed to. However, I did get very numb towards the end of the flights. At 8-9 hours per leg, this wasn't unexpected. The quality of the food was good. I had the gluten free meal and my partner the normal. Both flavour, variety and good portion sizes. I didn't feel like the gluten free option meant I had substandard food, so I would take this into account if you have any intolerances. The entertainment was very good. We were spoilt for choice for films and TV shows, and the inflight status was a nice extra. The larger screens were on two of our flights, and were much more responsive than the smaller, older versions on our other two flights. For the smaller screens, we just used the physical controllers, but these were easy enough to use too. All of the staff were highly professional, prompt and courteous. We had a few smiles as well.  All in all I'm very happy with my experience from Emirates. The flight weren't cheap at £580 return, but there were many cheaper options available. I'm glad we chose to pay the extra £100 for Emirates as the extra comfort went a long way for such a big journey.",10,7th May 2018,United Kingdom
826,"✅ Trip Verified | This flight was the typical Europe to Dubai flight. Every aspect of the flight in the hands of Emirates went well. The Emirates driver picked us up spot on time and delivered us to Amsterdam airport where we quickly dropped our luggage. (We were already checked in using the Emirates app which is very user-friendly). Departure was on time and we were actually more often addressed in Dutch then when flying KLM! There was a large contingent Dutch-speaking flight attendants on board. Even the captain appeared to be Dutch and all announcements were made in Dutch, English and Arabic. Priority cards were given for immigration in Dubai which went quite fast especially considering the huge amount of flights arriving around midnight in Dubai. Luggage was quickly delivered and we were driven by an Emirates driver to our hotel. Whatever negatively influenced the experience was Amsterdam Schiphol Airport. Unhelpful and unfriendly security agents, an overcrowded Aspire lounge and a total chaos at the gate.",7,5th May 2018,Netherlands
827,"✅ Trip Verified |  Taipei to Dubai. The crew is always busy with something else on the plane instead of attending to the passengers. My light was on for the entire beginning of the flight and no one attended until I called a flight attendant. There was one compartment was open for the beginning of the aircraft descending and we had to call them to make them aware of how dangerous it is. The bathroom was dirty and not even enough toilet Paper. No crisps no chocolates no peanuts but biscuits! Everybody doesn’t want a roll if you just want to nibble and then you bring your own snacks when you already paid for a ticket and there is Not enough breakfast or lunch or Dinner of Choice.  They serve disgusting food, I am a westerner not an Asian and they offer me noodles as not enough western breakfast?

Our seats were changed without notice.I would like to clarify that the seat from Dubai to Paris was already allocated to us in Singapore Changi Airport. Our seats was arrange seated together.

829,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to New York JFK. The service was very good, the crew was efficient and responsive. The condition of the toilets was very, very poor. The number of passengers using the toilets warrants that someone clean the toilets, including the floor, at regular intervals during a 13 hour flight. It is not sufficient to clean only before and after a flight. I realize crew may not see this as within their job but there is something off kilter about handing out scented warm towels, booties and toothbrushes but expecting passengers to use filthy toilets.",3,30th April 2018,United States
830,"✅ Trip Verified | Bangkok to Istanbul via Dubai. I’ve used Emirates for connecting flights several times and decided never to use it again. I recommend everyone to avoid a connecting flight in Dubai with Emirates. The airport is huge and making a transfer in the airport requires a lot of time and patience. It is always very crowded and even finding somewhere to sit except restaurants or cafes sometimes impossible. There are always long queues for security checks. The terrible flight experience in my recent flight proved it: Emirates recommends to spare at least 1 hour for making transfer in Dubai. In my latest flight from Bangkok to Istanbul, the connection time was 1hour 15 minutes. The flight from Bangkok to Dubai delayed 45 minutes, which means that I will definitely miss my flight in Dubai to Istanbul. Despite this fact, ground staff in Bangkok reassured me that I would make the connection and there would be a ground staff at Dubai airport waiting to assist for the connection flight to Istanbul. When I arrived at Dubai airport 45 minutes delayed, the ground personal informed me that my seat to Istanbul was cancelled and handed me the voucher for a hotel and food. She told me that my flight would be tomorrow at 2.30 pm UAE time. With no further assistance she left. I had many more troubles in the latter times of my journey. The response I received from the customer service regarding my complaints were not satisfactory and disrespectful. My latter complaints were totally ignored. Other issues with this airline: Their seat layout 3-4-3 seat, which means the corridors are thin and the cabin is filled more passengers. It makes you feel claustrophobic. One annoying thing about their entertainment system is that you have to watch several commercials before the movies or any other videos. Yes it is cheaper compared to other airlines and maybe should be listed in budget airline category.",2,29th April 2018,Turkey
831,"✅ Trip Verified | I used to brag about using Emirates but no more. Had two bad flights with them this time. Dirty tray tables, blocked toilet sinks, dirty toilets and two broken seats. Seat would not stay in one position, every time I moved the seat reclined. Interesting the cabin crew tell you seats must be in an upright position for takeoff, if it IS broken they don’t care! Had two broken seats in two flights. Customer services don’t care unless you are what they want (Business and First class). Not wasting any more money on them when you can get a budget flight at a fraction of the cost and the same service.",10,29th April 2018,United Kingdom
832,"✅ Trip Verified |  Birmingham to Cape Town via Dubai. Booked flight online for myself, partner and my 16 year old daughter only to be asked at check in for her birth certificate and a lawyers letter to enter South Africa. At no point during the flight booking did it flag up the fact these documents were required. The man on check in  kept referring to the need for a visa to enter South Africa hence the requirement for paper work. You do not need a visa to enter South Africa. Surely the need for birth certificates etc should be flagged on entering each passengers DOB to prevent this happening. I contacted the South African immigration whilst the man continued to deny my daughter and told that they would have had no problem allowing my 16 year old daughter to enter. Still she was refused. The customer service manager did not even take the time to listen to us. He appeared to take great delight in shattering my daughters long awaited visit to South Africa.

833,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Bangkok. Emirates have an economy class seats on the upper deck of their A380. I got the chance to reserve the seat in advance. The upper cabin is spacious than the lower cabin with 2-4-2 layout. Add to that the side storage bins for those seating in the window seat. The flight was full because of the Songkran Festival in Thailand. Drinks and a small pack of biscuit was given right after take off. Lunch was serve almost two hours into the flight which i guess is a bit early for a 6 hour flight. Drinks and wet towel were provided before we land. The front lavatory on the upper deck are spacious. Unfortunately, those seating on the upper deck cannot go down the lower deck to roam and stretch their legs. Emirates' ICE is was superb. I got to enjoy the view from the plane's outside camera.",3,23rd April 2018,United Arab Emirates
834,✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to New York via Dubai. Emirates standards have really dropped. Cons: Emirates b class lounge in terminal b in morning time is a joke. Food is consistently bad in these lounges and there is no a la carte. There is not a single chair to sit on. Horrible experience. Very noisy with spoons and plates clattering all the time. There are a ton of food options but all of them mass produced and on a hot dish. In flight experience also Emirates has no a la carte concept. Either you chose from that menu in those 3 hours or forget about it. No good soups or mild flavours they again gs for quantity over quality. During the entire time of 15 hours cabin crew is going by back and forth making sleep difficult. TheWorst part however is the fact that there is lounge in JFK. This is simple not acceptable. They give a 40 usd voucher which you can Use in any restaurant but almost all restaurants were closing. So I had a glass of wine and fries in McDonald’s. This is unacceptable. Pros: flight attendants on all sectors were very nice and tried to make up for an old and tired airline. Overall unless you aren’t price conscious or have to use up some old miles stay away from emirates,10,23rd April 2018,India

837,"✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Christchurch. Incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel that may cost me over $400 On April 8, 2018, my wife and I were travelling on EK412 from Sydney to Christchurch. We were carrying an expensive PC as a gift to our daughter for her graduation from the university that we purchased in Australia and we planned to claim tax refund. It’s a common knowledge (and a common sense, too) that goods need to be produced to a tax refund officer to obtain tax refund. To our knowledge, at Sydney Airport tax refund office is located beyond check-in, immigration and security and I intended to bring the PC there. The box was pretty bulky, and I was told that I had to check it in. It was a natural question that I asked the check-in assistant – how was I supposed to produce it to a tax refund officer if I do that. The junior assistant who was checking us in didn’t know the answer and asked her supervisor by name David. David assured us that producing receipt to a tax refund officer was sufficient to claim tax and that goods don’t need to be necessarily produced if they’re checked in, so we checked the box in along with our luggage. At the tax refund office, the officer requested me to produce the goods besides the receipt, which I was unable to do. The officer then said that I had to produce it to a tax refund officer located before check-in point, of which the airline should have informed me. When I replied that the airline advised me that the good don’t need to be produced to a tax refund officer and producing receipt alone is sufficient to claim tax refund, the officer still accepted my claim but it’s now up to decision of the main office in Canberra, whether I will receive tax refund after not being able to produce the goods. Thus, the incompetence of Emirates check-in personnel in matters of tax refund may cost me over $400 if my claim is ultimately not entertained. What are you going to do about this, Emirates?",1,16th April 2018,Singapore

Ticketing was not transferred properly from one airline to the other airline and we have had to scrumble to find our own way. When customer purchased a ticket from one airline their expectation is solely to that particular airline. Otherwise we could have chosen other airlines. Nearly missed our flight. Treated poorly at counter and was told it was ticketed by another airline so we didn't get to choose seats, food or nothing at all. Essentially a subclass customers. We did not know nor had chosen Qantas and Jestar. Not once heard of Emirates other than paying more and handed to other airline including a budget airline.

Unbelievably, they do not respond to the guests. They do not say a word other than ""commands"" to guests. They talk only when they have to instruct guests. I did not hear thank you, welcome, sorry, even when they forgot to distribute food and beverages to us. Not sure it is their culture or lack of company training, but, they looked quite rude to me.

When compared with the likes of British Airways, Etihad and American Airlines, Emirates wins by a mile. Todays flight was excellent. The First class cabin was lovely, the onboard Spa was truly refreshing and spacious. I was well looked after by the head purser on this flight. The food and beverage offer were of high quality, and last but not least, the ICE entertainment was phenomenal - you are literally spoilt for choice. The chauffeur driven services in both destinations were excellent and extremely useful; a superb feature when travelling premium.

844,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Cape Town via Dubai. We chose to experience Emirates based on their reputation, despite taking a longer route via DBX. Apart from the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screen, the flight was fine. Cabin temperature could have been slightly warmer for comfort. The second leg from Dubai to Cape Town on an older 777 was much less than perfect. On one of our seats the overhead light was not working and given this was a night flight needed. Whilst on the stand I reported this to a member of staff who told me that they could not move us to another seat as we were a couple. We had the usual issues with the in flight entertainment screens with random actions and scrolling cursors. The area we were seated in was extremely cold and my wife ended up using four of the airline blankets to try and be warm enough to get some sleep. I went for a walk around the economy area and found in all other areas the temperature was adequate. We appeared to be sat below an air con portal blowing cold air. This affected say ourselves and another dozen or so passengers who could be spotted by their huddled looks with coats and blankets. When I asked about this I was told that “Computer says” it’s 25 degrees. In our zone it was probably about 12 degrees. The member of staff was dismissive. It would have been bad enough if they had agreed but apologised that nothing could be fixed in-flight. I decided to seek the supervisor. In regards to the heating they did accept there was a fault and that staff should have not tried to ignore the issue. On the matter of the overhead light they said that we could have been reseated in row 50 as there was space at take off. They agreed with comments about the issues and the poor customer service. They said they would take immediate verbal action with staff in flight and would file a report regarding my issues at base. They presented me with a business card without names on and an email address to write to. On arrival in Cape Town I sent a comprehensive report to the alleged customer service email on the business card. I received a curt rejection pointing me to the on-line complaints form. Emirates customer complaints response indicates that their target is to respond in 30 days. Having heard nothing before we were heard nothing before we were due to fly back home. On my return via Johannesburg, I asked to speak to the Emirates group side manager, to see if anything had been planned in response to our complaint. After a long period of time the manager informed me that it was with the UK Customer Relations unit and still under investigation. To date still no contact some 37 days later. On the return trip home my wife encountered a problem with a member of staff pointing her finger to get out of the way effectively, without saying a word. Another poor PR exercise was a steward reading a tablet and in the hearing of others selecting a passenger individually and indicating they were a frequent customer and if there is anything I can do for you my name is...  My general feeling is that Emirates is resting on its historic reputation. Having flown Qatar Airways they are still maintaining customer services a better standard. In short not worth the effort of flying Emirates!",10,9th April 2018,United Kingdom
845,"✅ Trip Verified | This was my first time traveling with Emirates and couldn’t recommend them highly enough. The service was first class and the staff were welcoming and friendly. On our return flight my friend, a very anxious flyer, was reassured and regularly checked on during the flight. I will definitely use and recommend the airline for future flights. Thank you to the cabin crew on the Dubai to Glasgow flight on Saturday 7th April.",10,9th April 2018,United Kingdom
846,"✅ Trip Verified | Terrible service. Crew members were all too proud to be serving customers - no smile, no thank you, no please. I don’t know if this was arrogance or they were simply too proud to be serving customers. There were supposed to be a choice of main course, however, all I got was ‘grilled chicken’ without being offered a choice and the meal tray was passed from behind me so I had to turn my back to take the tray. Totally unprofessional. I don’t know what the hype is about with Emirates. I will never travel on Emirates again unless I have to without being offered a choice. I also want to mention that the check in staff at DXB was terrible. Again no smile, no welcome, no nothing. Basically not interested in serving customers.",1,6th April 2018,Hong Kong
847,"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates have become a low cost carrier. Flew Christchurch to Sydney on A380 in business class, EK413. Whilst this is a short flight I have paid a premium for business class, Emirates are now at a race to the bottom for service. The A380 business class is the new economy class. There are so many people to cater for staff can not handle it. No pre-dinner drink offered and had to ask twice for a drink. Staff were rude and unfriendly. Dinner was inedible and no drink service, again had to ask for a glass of wine and by the time it came out it was the end of service. Last time I flew Emirates I had noticed the deterioration of service. I didn't think it could get any worse.",1,6th April 2018,Australia
848,✅ Trip Verified | I was travelling Dubai to Mumbai. At the time of check-in I forgot my passport pouch at the check in counter. I realized that when I was about to board the flight. I got in touch with the ground staff and they helped me in finding my lost pouch within very short time. I really appreciate the ground staff effort.,3,4th April 2018,United States
849,✅ Trip Verified | Ft Lauderdale to Hyderabad via Dubai. Emirates is the worst airline I have seen so far. Their staff force customers from economy class to pay extra for luggage. I have checked in 2 bags and have a carry-on bag and a laptop bag with me. I had a stop in Dubai. They checked the weight of carry on in Dubai. I made some shopping in Dubai duty free. They are checking even duty free weight and charging extra for that. They made me pay 200$ for 2 kgs extra which includes duty free weight. I will never ever travel again with Emirates.,9,4th April 2018,United States
850,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Sydney. The boarding time was incredibly confusing with the boarding process slightly disorganised. We were  greeted onboard with champagne before take off. Once airborne, the dinner service was incredibly drawn out from taking orders to serving the dishes and drinks. From what I can see most of the cabin crew looked tired and wanted the process to be over, with not many smiles going around only person stood out when she introduced herself. I managed to get 3-4 hours of sleep as the seat was quite comfortable but I can see the hard product is ageing. Breakfast was very unsatisfactory, basically fruit and bread which is nothing exciting for me to talk about. The IFE was amazing, with its many options I was entertained the whole flight. Overall, the experience was very average and not up to scratch and by far it's my least favoured experience with Emirates in a premium cabin.",10,2nd April 2018,Australia
851,"✅ Trip Verified |  Gatwick to Bangkok via Dubai. The car arrived 15mins early on an icy morning, very nice driver who took a slightly longer but safer route to Gatwick. Orderly at check-in, swiftly through security and into the Emirates lounge. Breakfast with newspapers and excellent coffee. The lounge staff are always subtly cheerful. Uneventful flight through to Dubai. The ICE entertainment and Wifi excellent. Easy transit to the business lounge and boarding connecting flight is directly from the lounge. Slept most of the flight into Bangkok, but woken by cabin crew in time for breakfast. Arrived on time. Fast track voucher gets you through Bangkok Suvarnabhumi immigration very efficiently, very long queues outside the priority lanes. 15-20 min wait for baggage to arrive. Emirates driver waiting at exit 5 as usual, immaculate car with the day's papers and bottles of chilled water at your disposal. I use this service 4-5 times a year, it is just so reliable and excellent value for money.",1,31st March 2018,United Kingdom
852,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Amsterdam to Dubai. Emirates has some of the laziest cabin crew in the industry. The quality of their service has been tanking for years now and whereas small details used to set a new standard, most of these details are no longer offered. I have flown Emirates many times and somehow they never manage to leave on time - and rarely do they make up for lost time. This flight for example landed 40 minutes past schedule. When you leave later and spend more time on board, details start to matter. Like for example how long it takes before meals are served. But even as important as when the meal trays are collected. The first they try to stall for obvious reasons, they used to serve 2 meals on these flights and now 1 and some crackers. The later they serve it, the less obvious the difference. The second causes unnecessary annoyance. When you’re in a window seat and have to wait for 1 hour and 40 minutes for them to clear the trays - and you have to use the toilet - you’re going to start having doubts about their service. Their crew are more occupied getting to know each other and sharing party stories than being involved in the service they should offer. In the absence of alternatives like Qatar Airways, you’re almost forced to fly Emirates to most of the Middle East, which is another annoyance. I am starting to give up hope the Emirates of the 2008-2013 era will ever return. They have become a very ordinary airline with nothing special to offer except a large screen (which I don’t even use because I prefer to sleep).",7,30th March 2018,Netherlands
853,✅ Trip Verified | Flew Johannesburg to Beijing via Dubai with Emirates. Very disappointing! No coffee was served. I asked 3 times for a cup of coffee but didn't get it. The 'breakfast' consisted of frozen pieces of fruit which had been too cold to eat for someone who has got senstive teeth. The croissant was dry and nothing to swallow it down. Only tea was served. I don't drink tea.,3,29th March 2018,South Africa
854,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Phnom Penh to Yangon. Excellent in all respects. In particular, the plane appeared very new/clean, and the IFE was outstanding - large size screen with excellent choice. You could even watch live Premier League games. All cabin crew were extremely friendly and obliging, clearly taking pride in their jobs. The only negative was the price, Emirates had significantly raised the price of the flight from a few weeks earlier, when I previously took the same flight.",9,26th March 2018,Myanmar
855,"✅ Trip Verified |  Athens to Newark. Overall good, but nothing really special. I was excited to book this flight, it was my first time flying on an Emirates flight and I couldn't wait. Everything was good, in terms of food, comfort, service etc, I found cool the Amenities Kit, but the expectations were so high, I wouldn't say I am fully satisfied. On top, it's great it's a direct flight from Athens, but you land to Newark, not JFK, and it's a bit tricky to reach NYC very late at night.",1,25th March 2018,Greece
856,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Emirates from New York JFK to Milan. The flight itself was good, but! This is a big but! They do not call groups, they form lines like cattle and make you wait! In my case 40 minutes standing in very warm conditions, 10 minutes late. I am extremely unhappy with their boarding process, horrible.",1,23rd March 2018,United States
857,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Rome. I'm so disappointed. I have been flying with EK since 2002 and in the last 3 years i have seen a constant decline. It has now hit the bottom. Travelling to Rome has been a disaster from the start. At online check in, i could not find seats next to my 9 year old son. I couldn't book his seat without paying extra 50$ (my seat was free because of skywards) on top of the 900$ premium cost of the ticket itself (seriously this is what you claim in your radio ads favouring families). Called the call center. First time i was told there are no seats available (yet the app shows seats on rows 22, 23, 36 and 50). The second time I was told these seats are not eligible for children (seriously? bassinet seats not eligible?) and third time i was asked for 90$ to change my seats. Bottom line, no longer worth the premium paid. It used to be worth every cent extra, now even FlyDubai offers a better service (and you dont even pay for seats at check in!) Sad,  demise of EK myth.",10,21st March 2018,United Arab Emirates
858,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Chennai via Dubai. I really had a very bad experience with Emirates.  I didn't know that number of bags reduced from 4 to 3 and the front desk people asked me to arrange bags and charged me 10lb extra weight fee of $50 and verified my cabin bag weight(8kg). After cleared the security, I bought some duty free stuffs from Chicago ORD airport and there is no question in Chicago airport boarding.After I reached Dubai when I board Chennai Airport Emirates staff asked me to weight cabin bag and duty free stuff and they said everything has to be placed in the cabin bag. They kicked out me out of the queue and asked me to arrange my luggage. I spent 10-15 minutes to arrange everything. After arranging every stuffs they said my cabin is overweight (includes duty free stuff). They suggested to reduce weight by throwing some stuff in trash or return duty free stuffs. Since the duty free stuffs I bought from US I couldn't able to return and they said I need to pay fee then only they can let me in. Staff behavior is totally not unacceptable, Emirates staffs are trying to steal money from customers my saying you have addition weight on your luggage. Staffs didn't say anything about the price detail and they charged me USD120 which more than the dutyfree stuff/10lb extra weight. Finally I saw my card was Charged $120 for $80 dollar stuff. This is my worst travel experience ever. If you have a policy then why are you allowing the duty free in ORD airport and not Dubai. If the duty free stopped in ORD airport I would have returned in ORD airport. Since the duty free stuffs are allowed in ORD I couldn't able to return in Dubai and I am force to pay. I am returning back to US today and restricted my baggage today to avoid any confusion but there is no cabin baggage verification or weight check happened today. Few of the economy passengers have both Cabin luggage and back pack and some of them have cabin luggage, back pack and Duty free from Dubai but no one was checking. It's looks like Emirates strictly applying this to Indians who is going to India from Dubai and try to get huge amount of fee. I still not convinced after today's flight baggage weight monitoring.",1,16th March 2018,United States
859,"✅ Trip Verified |  Athens to Newark. On a scheduled 11 hour flight from Athens, not once except with meals were refreshments offered, including water, and beverages, etc. This was a flight during daylight hours so the cabin crew did not have a reason to not offer drinks. When a person requested a beverage it was obvious that the cabin crew was annoyed with the request, even though their ads on the inflight entertainment was stressing to stay hydrated during the flight. This was just the opposite of our experience on Singapore airline where the cabin crew came through about every 30 minutes offering drinks, sandwiches, fruit and candy bars including Toblerone candy bars. I was surprised n the difference in service between Emirates and Singapore Airlines. We encountered the same lack of service from Newark to Athens as we did on the longer return trip.",5,16th March 2018,United States
860,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cape Town to Phuket via Dubai. Very robotic service. Crew indifferent. Qatar is far more professional and provide a better service.

If you get can a cheap fare then I recommend Emirates, otherwise Qatar is my preferred carrier.",8,16th March 2018,South Africa
861,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hyderabad to New York JFK via Dubai. Business class seating, comfort is great. But the service is appalling, really disappointed if this is the kind of service we get in Business Class - what about Economy? Skipped my dinner - mentioned the hostess that I will skip dinner but will have breakfast later and also mentioned what I like to have for breakfast. She noted it down and breakfast time came and went and I kept waiting for mine - at about the end of the breakfast hostess explains that the breakfast what I ordered is not there and I have to pick something else. Couple of things here, they decide to come and tell me that they are out when the flight is about the descent to the destination, and hostess who knew that I skipped Dinner does not bother to come and explain the same earlier. Regardless, I had lost my appetite by then - asked them to not bother, but they insisted to get a hindu meal(as that was the only thing available), but that turned out to be stale. So they were successful in making me fast during the flight. I would think twice before I fly emirates again....",5,15th March 2018,United States
862,"✅ Trip Verified |  New York JFK to Abuja via Dubai. I had a terrible experience. When I got to Dubai, I had to pay 130USD (455 Durham) because my hand luggage was overweight by just 3kg.  Emirates keep advertising duty free stuff on board and when people buy, they  insist they pay excess when they have a connecting flight. There is absolutely no value for money, with the long trip of over 20 hours from New York to Nigeria, and the airline exploiting passengers, I am never flying Emirates again.",3,13th March 2018,Nigeria
863,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Lahore via Dubai, flight was fantastic. The aircraft was like new, the food was very good and so was the service. Plenty of space and great entertainment. The connection was on a Boeing 777 just as good. On the way back from Dubai I was shocked to see that in the whole A380 (EK29) there were only 46 passengers. We should have been given a free up grade. Book early for cheap flights.",8,11th March 2018,United Kingdom
864,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brussels to Chennai via Dubai. Major concerns regarding Emirates flight and ground staff support at Dubai. My mother was traveling Emirates from Brussels to Chennai with stopover in Dubai. Knowing her medical condition, I ensured she would have a wheelchair from departure to destination for each flight. Due to her medical condition, she’s unable to walk. This wheelchair was once again confirmed prior to her flight. And again after her flight experience. Each time an Emirates representative told me that her wheelchair is booked all along each stop. However on 23rd February 2018, upon arrival in Dubai, she wasn’t given a wheelchair, instead ground staff rudely told her she had to walk as they couldn’t accommodate her a wheelchair.  Did not expect this from Emirates. As a result my mother was helped by 3 other passengers who helped her reach her connecting flight.  At this point I’m besides myself and have no words to express my fury over Emirates and its customer service. On her return flight on March 6, we had made multiple calls and emails requesting the highest level of wheelchair (apparently Emirates has levels of wheelchairs). Yes once again, she was denied a wheelchair at Dubai airport. Instead, Ground staff made her walk. Emirates have no customer service skills nor respect for their customers.",6,10th March 2018,United States
865,"✅ Trip Verified |  Chicago to Chennai via Dubai. I  travel business class and always take carry-on luggage, a carry-on suitcase and a backpack.  In my backpack I carry my iPad, laptop, and occasionally a camera. I have travelled many airlines all business class with two carry-on pieces. For the first time, I was stopped at the Dubai Airport at the gate by Emirates gate agents and asked to pay an additional $80 dollars to get on Flight EK542 to Chennai on February 24 because my carry-on luggage was apparently over the weight limit. At the same time, there were a number of other business-class passengers who were allowed to board the aircraft with more than two carry-on pieces or carry-on pieces that were larger than what was allowed. I was not asked to pay extra on any of the other flights on this booking. Only on this flight going to Chennai. I pointed out that I was coming from Chicago, had no check-in luggage, and the check-in desk in Chicago had no problem with my luggage. I also pointed out that I travel business class all the time on many different airlines and this is the first time that I was being asked to pay extra at the gate. They would not listen and forced me to pay an extra $80 on top of the business class fare before I could board the flight. This was unfair given that they were not enforcing their rules strictly for other business class passengers.  I am now very reluctant to fly Emirates again.

Flight attendant said he would bring another ear piece, one hour later he said he forgot. Told him it's the jack that was not working, not the ear piece. One hour later, he brought another ear piece, then one more. Smarter supervisor listened and said that it unfortunately was the jack that was not working.

Would definitely recommend Emirates.",1,5th March 2018,Cambodia
868,"✅ Trip Verified | Milan to Dubai. On one hand I was lucky to have on the side the middle seat empty and that has definitely ensured more comfort. However on the other side WiFi wasn’t working (not the airline’s fault, just some technical issue). The food was excellent and so the wine. Chicken breast in economy class is normally very dry. This wasn’t the case and the mushroom gravy was great. Great service by the attendants, always alert and ready to help. Large screens, plenty of entertainment and great movies. All this made the flight very pleasant and makes me want to fly Emirates again sometime soon.",6,4th March 2018,United Arab Emirates
869,"✅ Trip Verified |  Due to weather conditions, my flight from Birmingham to Kolkata via Dubai got cancelled after 3 hours from check in at the airport. While other airlines were distributing food coupons after the delayed flights Emirates said they'll transfer us to hotel in their coach. We stood at the conveyor belt and collected my luggage which were distributed between two belts. We came out to find out that there is no coach, no hotel. Emirates made the promise while they were trying to arrange for hotels, they either don't know their verbs or plain lied. Their latest version was 'we are suggesting you go home and we will contact you when you are rescheduled'. A flight can get cancelled due to weather conditions but can a reputed brand act such foolishly and keep lie conveniently and put their valued customer in a vulnerable situation. While UK came to standstill I was dragging 50kg luggage in snow all by myself at 10pm in the night.",5,4th March 2018,United Kingdom
870,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hong Kong to Dubai. I was sitting in 42C (originally sitting on 42B but changed seats by someone else) on the aisle. The flight was really full that it was trying to get all travelers from Hong Kong and nearby cities to Dubai. The boarding gate was fair that I need to take the train to my boarding gate.  Cabin crew were nice and ready to help us. The meal selection included either Chicken or Beef, which I chose the Chicken with pasta which I think the taste is fair, not really good at all. I had ordered their cup noodles as well but it was neither taste well . The ICE flight entertainment is really good, however the hardware was not so adapted into it. The plane was quite old and they use the setup which years ago does. I could understand with that but I think it's time to get some renovation on that plane, which they could change to the setup on their Boeing 777-300ER. After some time of sleep, the snack came with Beef sandwich with drinks. Even though the sandwich was dry, it tastes better than the dinner. Before the flight landed, some travelers attempted to change seat even though the belt sign was on for a while, the cabin crew had to yell to stop them but those travelers changed anyway. The flight arrive Dubai almost an hour earlier than expected. Hope next time I will have better experience on this flight.",5,3rd March 2018,Hong Kong
871,✅ Trip Verified | Flew from London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai. I have been flying with Emirates for a long long time and I love their service. Their A380 is fantastic but their 777 service on the Dubai to Dhaka flight did downgrade a little and they should improve on that so it is how they used to be on that route in the past. Their Dubai to London service has been amazing as always. Would recommend this airline.,1,2nd March 2018,United Kingdom
872,"✅ Trip Verified |  Travelled from Birmingham to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai, with a 24 hrs stop in Dubai on return. Chauffeur came on time as arranged. Lovely chap. Got to BHX. Dropped off directly outside check in. First time at this airport and not impressed. Lounge is small with a selection of warm food. Struggled to get reception to use mobile. Seat 20A although business class felt claustrophobic. Food was nicely presented. Wasn’t too keen on starter (the chicken mango confit) main Opted for duck which was lovely. No amenity bag given on day flight. Which is a shocker. Flight was full as such the bar area was packed. Arrived at DXB connecting flight in concourse B. Business lounge seem like a free for all where they allowed anyone in. Over crowded and not enough seating. Showers busy, dark and outdated. Flight to KL seats better. Night flight food was breakfast. Had the omelette which wasn’t overly nice. Arrived on time. Had to get train to the baggage hall. 1st one to arrive. My flight companion bag came off 1st. However due to error by BHX not labelling my bag correctly with business tag it came off around an hour later with the economy passengers. As such missed my connection. Anyway return journey in business lounge in KL very small. Showers were a bit worn out and not clean. Food was barely warm and limited. Night flight and managed to get a few hours sleep. Breakfast served was same as on way in therefore wasn’t too keen. Just had hot chocolate and cake. Arrived 4:30am. Had 24 hrs in Dubai. Freshened up in lounge then went into Dubai city. Final leg was departing from concourse A which was world apart from B. It was much cleaner. Less crowded and overall better. Showers nice and clean. Was offered slippers too. Food was more fresh. There was a nice white area with a lounge chair where I managed to get a few hours sleep before the flight. Boarded return to Manchester. Again night flight. Breakfast options so slept all way. Best sleep so far on the 4 sector of the journey. Maybe because I was tired. Service good, food fair Business lounge-concourse B poor, concourse A good. Value for money reasonable Overall reasonable, but Qatar business class considered better based on this experience.",10,1st March 2018,United Kingdom

It was the little touches that made a difference like taking a Polaroid of the kids for them to take as a souvenir, or wearing ""Happy New Year"" head gear as we were flying on New Years Eve. Seats had a lot of leg room. I was sat next to the window and didn't feel claustrophobi, probably as the plane's walls don't curve in so much on the lower deck and the windows are so large. Main problems were the IFE wasn't working properly - plus  the system was trying to offer too much (i.e. loads of films) without much thought gone into the execution and ease of use of it. Other problem was the food. Really appalling! Was happy to go hungry instead.",3,25th February 2018,United Kingdom

This is why I avoid Emirates wherever possible. I also messaged the Country Manager of Emirates for Norway and Iceland), he was aware of issues but not willing to do anything to make up for the farce. ",1,19th February 2018,Norway
876,"✅ Trip Verified | We've had a pretty good experience. The lounge in Amsterdam Emirates shares with other airlines is nothing to write home about. The A380 is a marvellous machine, though the seat arrangement is not couple friendly if you want to sit next to a window. You can only sit together in the middle rows. The service and the food were as expected. The sky bar is a fantastic gimmick except if you want to sleep with your seat close to the bar. Choose a seat away from the bar if you want quiet. Our connecting flight departed from Terminal C which we did not particularly like. Lots of construction going on. The Emirates Lounge offers less amenities than the one in Terminal B. However, the food selection was excellent. The Dubai to Mumbai leg was a bit of a letdown. The plane looked rather old. The age of the airliner was particularly evident in the entertainment system. The screen resolution was that of the past decade, so underwhelming. The remote control still had a phone on one side which says it all. The service and the breakfast served were good however. After this experience we were worried that for the return leg to Dubai again and old 777-300ER would be used. Additionally, web check-in did not work and our hotel only reached their Mumbai office after trying all day. We did not know whether we would be seated together until we arrived at Mumbai airport. To our pleasent surprise we were seated together and the plane was much newer with excellent screens, the separate iPad and the remote control that looks like a Playstation portable. The range of Entertainment programs Emirates' ICE system offers is fabulous. We used the lounge in Terminal B which is superior to the one in Terminal C. An absolute highlight is the Moet and Chandon bar. Very friendly staff. The last leg from Dubai to Amsterdam was again an excellent experience with good food and friendly service. The limousine transfer worked well. However, the communcation skills of the limousine service center in Mumbai could be improved. Communcation was done with abbreviated text messages and rather informal, the way teenagers communicate.",8,19th February 2018,Switzerland

There is plenty of legroom, inflight entertainment system is wonderful. A large range of TV shows, movies and documentaries suited for all tastes.

878,✅ Trip Verified |  I flew overnight Birmingham to Dubai then 1hour 30min stopver before flight to Melbourne. Upon arriving in Dubai I checked the board and saw Emirates flight to Melbourne leaving from gate x so I headed to gate x. Then I checked another board and it said gate z for Emirates flight to Melbourne. I figured that gate had changed and headed to gate z. When boarding was happening for Emirates flight to Melbourne at gate z they informed me I had missed my flight which left from gate x. They were very rude and said I had to go to the Emirates connections counter. They informed me that there were 2 Emirates flights to Melbourne  leaving an hour apart and I had gone to the wrong gate. I also discovered that Dubai airport had a new policy (6 months) of no flight boarding announcements or for late passengers so they can have a nice quiet airport where passengers miss their flights. I said to the Emirates staff that they had a duty of care to inform me at check in that there was 2 flights leaving to Melbourne so I wouldn't miss my flight. Another Emirates staff admitted to me that passengers miss this flight to Melbourne every day because of this 2 flight situation. Emirates would not change my ticket as well as Qantas who sold the original ticket (Airline partnership situation) so I had to buy a new ticket for that leg £440. So in summary Emirates knew passengers miss this flight everyday because of the unusual situation of 2 Emirates Melbourne flights leaving Dubai each day within 1 hour yet they choose not the inform their passengers at check in of this situation so they can daily double charge their passengers. Shame on Emirates and Shame on Qantas for this avoidable unfortunate situation.,1,15th February 2018,United Kingdom
879,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bali to Amsterdam via Dubai. I travelled with Emirates Back and fourth to Bali during the Christmas holiday. My experience of the flight was ok, but my experience with the transport of baggage and the customer service was the worst I have ever experienced. I go on a surf trip 3-4 times a year and I always pack my board the same way with allot of bubble wrapper, towels, pillows and a good board bag and I have never had any problems. On the trip down when I unpacked my board I had a few cracks that I had to fix. I called Emirates, and a very rude customer service member said that someone would call me up, of course no one did. But lesson learned. On my way back I packed my board even more carefully and added a fragile sign on the bag. To my chock when I packed up my board on arrival in Amsterdam, it was completely destroyed and rendered it useless. I called Emirates who refuse to take this matter on the telephone but told me they wont cover anything but I could send them a mail. Which I did. In the email I pointed to according to the Montreal convention they are responsible for any damage they cause on the baggage. The response was very simple. ""we are sorry for the broken board but we can and wont do anything about it, and we will not answer any more enquiries regarding this matter"" I have emailed them many times after that but the refuse to answer. My friend travelling to Copenhagen also got his board destroyed and same horrible treatment by Emirates. That’s why I write this review, I want to warn everybody to travel with Emirates! As long as you pay and shut up there is no problem but when they have caused a problem they wont do anything about it. If you Google similar matters you will see that I am not alone in being mistreated by emirates customer service. I will never travel with Emirates again. 0/10 points.",6,15th February 2018,Netherlands
880,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Fort Lauderdale to Casablanca via Dubai. For the longest time, I had wanted to fly Emirates, I was curious by its ads claiming to be the best economy airline in the world. In fact, about 2 years ago, I had the chance to travel to Dubai and visit Emirates training centre, where we toured the facilities, it all looked very impressive and glamorously chic. I could not wait to experience all the glamour they so advertised. I get to the counter to check in and I was expecting luxury, beautiful people in Emirates fashion, just like advertised, reality was far off as clerks at counter were just plain Janes, no problem at all, just felt cheated. Finally, boarding time came, and I was so anxious to get on board. As I get thru the plane’s door, I suddenly realize, is this a joke? Did I step into the wrong plane? Where is all the bedazzle, all the luxury, all the hype Emirates told me I should expect? As I walk thru first class, business class and finally economy, I am hit with the realization of stepping into an old aircraft, that is outdated and challenged in sophistication, style and leg room. Delta, United or American Airlines would have offered the same experience, so what makes Emirates the best economy airline in the world? This was scheduled to be a 14 + hour flight from Fort Lauderdale to Dubai, can’t Emirates use the most comfortable, newest aircrafts for these long-haul flights instead of using aircrafts that should only be used for local or short flights? Emirates certainly does not think so. Employee’s presentation, another let down, no gorgeous counter or on-board flight attendants which left a lot to be desired, not all smiles here, far from the gorgeous look I was expecting. Cabin service was a let down as well, for a 14-hour flight, I would have expected more than just dinner (when dinner was served, I had the Szechuan chicken, it was tasteless). Breakfast, a wine selection and at least a couple of snack offerings throughout the 14-hour flight, we had to get up and ask for water several times. Overall my first experience flying with Emirates was nothing as expected, it was just as underwhelming as flying with any other average airline in the market. I will say that Emirates has a brilliant marketing strategy, unfortunately, it took one time flying with them to debunk all the hype and to make me want to fly Delta or American internationally, again.

881,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairo to Bangkok via Dubai. Don't get fooled once you see an attractive ticket price, as those attractive prices have a dark side in the T&C, especially when you are dealing with a big airline like emirates, so they never solve the problem once it happens, and you start getting bullied by their complaint department. You will be surprised after all the marketing they do and ads, and they have those monsters in their back office! what even make it worst, is that I am a regular customer since 2008 & I am on their skyward mileage reward, with a very good/strong history but still wasn't enough, and they unleashed those complaint team on me. I bought a ticket with a stopover in Dubai, and I wanted to extend my trip for only 1 day more, so I went to their office and was notified that there is a condition in my ticket which doesn't allow me to stay 1 more day (Max 7 days), and if I want to stay then I have to pay several penalties which ends me up with paying almost the same price I paid for the 1st ticket! So I asked the guy to check if I buy a new 1 way ticket on the same date and surprisingly it was half the price of those penalties they wanted to apply on me! So I submitted a complaint, and  asked if there is a solution, as simply the penalties doesn't make any sense especially when the 1 way ticket is half the price of the penalty, and I also mentioned that who has the time to read the T&C unless he/she has nothing to do in the world, and I ended up my complaint with some cute pressure that if there is no solution, then I would like to cancel my skyward. The complaint department replied with we know that you read the T&C and we should apply those conditions on you, and there's no way out and please confirm that you want to cancel your skyward so we start processing the cancelation! They left me with no solution except checking 1 way ticket back.  Anyway, I only wanted to share my story so no one get fooled like me, and if you have the time to read the T&C then please do - otherwise you will get bullied by their complaint department.",7,10th February 2018,Egypt
882,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cebu to London via Dubai. The worst airline I’ve flown with. From check in to connecting flight in Dubai. The staff and cabin crew were rude. They have false reassurance that someone will assist me with my connecting flight which is just 1 hour and 30 minutes apart. I was desperate because even the checkin service staff on my connecting flight did not know where I’m supposed to go. She was even rude and unapproachable. And on top of it all, I am still missing with one luggage. When I got into the luggage desk they were all sarcastic. I have been travelling a lot and I have never been so badly treated like this before. Very lousy service. I’m very disappointed and so devastated because I still am waiting for my luggage. From the stress that I have that I’ll miss my connecting flight in Dubai to Heathrow since I checked in in the Philippines, to the handling of my luggage I am extremely dissatisfied.

I was travelling alone and my daughter had booked wheelchair assistance for my entire itinerary. I suffer from varicose veins and also had recently injured my knee, both added up causing unbearable pain. I was offered wheelchair assistance at DTW (Michigan) airport where I boarded the flight and my daughter went home relieved that I would be provided wheelchair assistance for the rest of my itinerary. However, I was left in the lurch when I arrived in Boston airport to board flight to Bangalore via Dubai. I had very little time left to board the flight and had to push myself to walk fast with the unbearable pain. This continued in Dubai airport as once again there was no wheelchair assistance provided in Dubai. I somehow managed this time as I had two hours twenty minutes to board the next flight. This left me wondering why I was promised wheelchair assistance if the airline was not able to provide the promised service.

I decided to stop what I was watching instead. I cannot complain to the crew as I notice the same issue with all other passengers when I looked at their screens. The crew is not good.

887,"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates service has really gone down in the last few years. Probably, it has resulted from the cost-cutting measures they had to take. It's competition Qatar Airways has, on the other hand, improved quite a lot and even Etihad has better service on some parameters. On my last trip I observed the following: 1) The flight was delayed from 4.10 to 4.40 from India according to the announcement but the flight actually started boarding at 5. Because of this most of us were running for our connecting flights in Dubai. 2) At least 10 passengers when reaching Zurich couldn't find their luggage and we hope to get it tomorrow. 3) They recently introduced a 20kg limit on international flights for the economy class. What a good way to surprise customers and make more money. 4) I cannot explain how rude the staff were. 5) The toilets were not clean and the body lotion was not refilled. 6) Headphones were not working and they had to change it twice for me. Oman Air has disposable earbuds, they should learn from that. 7) Food was awful. They should learn from Etihad or Qatar. I cannot even think of comparing Lufthansa or any other European Airline.",1,5th February 2018,Switzerland
888,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Birmingham to Sydney via Dubai. I fly this route frequently and this has been the worst case of passenger handling I have come across. Emirates has 2 gates (42 and 44) and 4 air bridges to load the plane, yet the affair was poorly managed and far beneath a quality airline. The attendant at the boarding gate lounge screened every boarding pass and sent various zones away to ‘take a seat’ (when there aren’t any seats near the gates). Perhaps use of a sign or 2 would be wise. Perhaps Emirates you can find a way to load a plane through 2 lounges without treating the passengers as inconvenient cattle. The staff gave poor instructions and were cranky with the crowd. Comments like ‘you’ll all get on’ shouldn’t be needed. At one point we were all told to line up against the glass outside the lounge like school kids. Enough to go back to Qatar or Etihad on my next flight.",1,4th February 2018,Australia

So I decided to go to the galley to get it myself. Where I was met by a cabin staff who initially refused to serve me but she started to question me why do I wanted the drink now ? What reason? Can't you wait?  I politely kept silent until I got my drink and went back to my seat. Few hours later and I had been no longer than 6 minutes in business class lavatory I heard banging on the door. I signaled I heard the knocking. Another minute later the banging started again as I was finishing washing my hands. Hurried up to open the door only to find the same staffd was knocking asking if all OK and questioning why I spent that much time in the toilet? I never responded but politely requested the purser who came to apologize. We all know that their service level is on the decline but never thought it would get that low.

890,"✅ Trip Verified |  Hamburg to Mumbai via Dubai. Emirates has been long projecting themselves as a premium airline but things have gone down the drain. While making online check-in, they only provide to reserve seats in the middle (check the attached picture). Aisle seats are basically reserved for higher class of Economy. This is unacceptable because it should be based on first come first serve basis. That's one of the reason why passengers do online check-in! For the return flight, aircraft was very light but the check-in staff was extremely stingy in regards with luggage. I was 3 kgs more than limit and when I pointed out the Emirates Online Published Baggage Policy that luggage ""not exceeding"" 32 kgs"", the staff abruptly replied ""this policy is only for US bound passengers"". But this is not mentioned anywhere. Clearly she was dodging the rule. It seemed more like, she has been instructed to shell out money. After after security check, the manager still wanted to weigh hand luggage before final boarding. Even after boarding and settling down, the manager came on-board to give us final notice that they might conduct a surprise check of hand luggage and have to pay double if found guilty. This was definitely the height! Honestly, I couldn't believe she made this announcement. On 3 out 4 flights, they served absolutely the same food, I couldn't see it anymore, forget about eating it. The staff was of mixed bag ranging between ""okay and poor"" with ""forced to work and doing a favour"" attitude. I fly twice a year long haul and based on my experience, I don't want to fly Emirates again. Their publicity and reality are worlds apart, get your acts together Emirates! Lots to learn from Singapore Airlines.",1,2nd February 2018,India
891,"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to Auckland via Dubai. Emirates fell very short of their much hyped quality service on the flight from Dubai to Auckland on 26 Dec 2017. I had the misfortune to fly with them from Dubai to Auckland. The ground staff were very rude and unhelpful in Dubai, it took an age to get our boarding passes checked and when I did eventually get to my allotted seat I found someone else sitting there with exactly the same boarding pass!! the airplane was pushing back for take off while I was still standing in the galley while the air crew were trying to find me a seat! what does that say about their Health and safety and security. Anyhow the killer was that after the 17 hour flight to Auckland we had to queue an extra 3 hours in the airport to record the fact that our bags had not arrived. In fact approximately 150 bags didn't make it to Auckland so there were massive queues. Emirates ground staff were totally unprepared despite the fact that Emirates knew for at least 17 hours that our bags would not arrive at the same time as us! They wasted a day of my holiday and limited what I could do on the following day as I had to be available to sign for the bags when they were eventually delivered. We were not the most inconvenienced passengers. There were others who missed their connection to south island and several people in wheelchairs also waiting in a queue for 3 hours with no refreshments offered or seating to help those less able to stand. Any organisation that was serious about delivering a quality service would have had sufficient staff available to process our basic details so that the missing luggage could be delivered and would have had seating refreshments for those who needed it. Whilst things can go wrong its how you deal with the mishaps that determines whether you deliver a quality service. I received no apology or compensation to make up for the inconvenience and loss of a days holiday caused by Emirates failure. so many lessons could be learned from this but I doubt it will. This cant be the first time they have had such a massive failure in the delivery of luggage. I've flown several times with Emirates and had to put up with everything from missed connections to having give up my seat so that the drunk the passenger next to me could be physically restrained  (a former Emirates crew member). not once have I received a formal apology or any compensation.

Not even a snack can be spared on those flights (even all the European airlines they try to talk down do a sandwich or a snack half-way through the flight). Where the meals themselves would come with a lot of things on the side and used to be of good quality, you now get the same half-seasoned and half-baked meals they even offer on budget airlines. The advertised WiFi is non-existent on many flights (yes, the you can connect to OnAir but mostly there is no connection behind it). The quality of their crew has been degrading as well.

The flights were smooth and not many turbulences. The food was just fine, but definitively not the same standard in quality, presentation or service like the one with competitors from Asia (Cathay) or Europe (Swiss). Emirates had excellent wines from France and Australasia on these flights, but the handling of those expensive wines by the crew was disappointing: mostly the crew filled the wineglasses completely and on one occasion the steward just filled the Great Bordeaux in the same glas I had enjoyed before a Merlot. The crew was very diverse with no minimal standard of service at all, overall plainly disappointing and a lot of times unprofessional. The best is the Entertainment systems which seems to have no limitation, definitively one of the best.

The entertainment was amazing but the touch screen was not responsive. The food was not that good to be frank and the cabin crew were very friendly. They gave toys for kids and had special food for them. Flight landed on time but we were parked away from the terminal and the bus took around 30 minutes to arrive at the aircraft. Since I had 5 hrs layover it was not a problem for me. The aircraft used on the DXB-DMM sector was a brand new aircraft and this aircraft was much better than the previous one. The screens were much larger and they were very responsive unlike the previous one but could not do much since it was only a 45 minute flight. The sandwich served was awful.

900,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. Emirates has changed the configuration of its daily Bangkok/Hong Kong return flight from 3 class to a reduced business class and substantially increased economy class. This results in a total of 615 passengers. The problem is that it is the front half of the upper deck that has been given over to economy resulting in premium passengers having to wait till these have disembarked before they can get off. Since lower deck passengers are also disembarking earlier, a quick exit to Immigration is now out of the question! Almost all other A380 operators more sensibly put the extra economy seats at the back of the upper deck. That said, Emirates service remains excellent. The Bangkok lounge offers a wide range of food and drink. On board hot towels are lightly scented and lunch menus have a choice of 3 entrees and superb wines. The bar offers premium liquors and many different canapés for those not wishing the full meal. I just have two slightly negative comments about the on-board service. With the reduced business class it would be nice if an after take-off drink is offered. Frequently one has to wait for up to 45 minutes for the meal service to start before any drinks are brought round. Secondly, despite the huge variety of entertainment offered, I still find the revised entertainment programme guide a total design mess. It is impossible to find out if movies are comedies/dramas/action etc. Worse, the guide provides no timings, so you have no idea if you have enough time to watch a full movie. The only way to check length is by wasting time loading each individual movie. For the price, though, EK remains an excellent choice on this route.",2,25th January 2018,Thailand

Emirates consistently top-notch when it comes to IFE, transfers at DXB, OnAir WiFi, chauffeur pick-up and drop-off, and lounges.

I had a sore throat and a cough while traveling so I went straight to the gate to request for a window seat and explained my condition to them but they denied my request. Over time, my health deteriorated a little more. When I went up to the gate staff to talk to them again, they called the medics to get me checked. The medics said I was okay to travel but at this point, the gate supervisor demanded for a doctor's note to ensure I was okay to fly. I don't understand why they needed a doctor's note when we the medics said okay. Anyway, I tried to convince the supervisor because it was incredibly important for me to get back to New York on Tuesday morning as I had some important meetings lined up. They refused. I was taken to the doctor which was one building away, and given some medicine. The doctor gave me a note in no time and I was sent back to the gate without any assistance. They took me to the hospital on the airport hospital shuttle but I was made to walk back in that condition. It took me 20 minutes to walk back to the gate to find the supervisor, who had told me I would be moved to the next flight instead once I have the doctor's note. There was no one at the gate and I was directed to the ticketing counter. After waiting the long line, they asked me to pay for my new flight, which I refused to do. First off, being a college student, I did not the money to pay for another ticket. Secondly, it wasn't my decision to not board the previous flight. The gate staff decided on my behalf and I shouldn't be made to pay for a decision they made. I tried to explain my situation to the person at ticketing but they were no help and asked me to wait another hour to see the manager, because there was a shift change apparently and they said I couldn't be helped. I finally got to see the manager and she directed me to the PRO office and said it wasn't in her hands. I walked to the PRO office and begged for help because at that point, I felt vulnerable. I was exhausted and hadn't sleep in over 24 hours. They kept stalling me and sending me to different authorities.  I waited until 7 and then finally the PROs called me in only to tell me I had to pay 740 AED for a flight change and that's all they can do. I felt emotionally drained so I did whatever they said to just get back home.  As a consequence, I missed my flight from JFK to ROC which I had to rebook at an extra cost.

Flight 229, Dubai to Seattle. I last flew Emirates business class two years ago and it was good. Since then, quality has severely declined. The aircraft for this flight was - according to the attendant - 15 days old. They attendants didn’t know how to use the seats. The seats themselves we not much wider than economy class. Though they were lie-flat seats, the seats were “cupped” so you sunk into the middle when you lie them flat. Uncomfortable! This could have been softened by an attentive and helpful staff member however even getting water was difficult. The flight attendants didn’t offer anything between breakfast and lunch nor between lunch and dinner. For business class, this is completely unacceptable. I had to ask several times just for water.

908,"✅ Trip Verified |  Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai. We were scheduled to fly out of Manchester airport on Wednesday 20th December at 20.35. On check in we noticed that the flight time had been changed to around 21.10. We were not notified of any changes and the Emirates staff who checked us in gave us no explanation as to why this had been moved. After being in the airport a couple of hours we then noticed our flight had been further delayed. We were meant to arrive into Dubai international at 07.45 for our flight to Bangkok at 09.35, so the fact that the flight was delayed made us worry as we did not know whether we would make our connection flight. As a result we contacted our travel agent at Flight centre about our concern whilst in the departure lounge at Manchester Airport. They called Emirates to raise the alarm that if there was a delay we would struggle to make a connection flight. We eventually boarded our flight and left Manchester almost two hours late and arrived in Dubai at 09.12. On the aircraft the captain told us that we were delayed due to the Emirates plane leaving Dubai late. We missed our flight, we had no apologies and the only option to get us to Bangkok in time for the 07.30 flight was to fly at 16.00 to Mumbai with Emirates and then a flight to Bangkok with Thai airways. This would land us at around 05.00 and in the meantime we would have a hotel room and lunch. We had to take this option but were not happy as this would mean we would lose our money on the hotel in Bangkok and our dinner reservation. However, the flight to Mumbai landed late, which caused us more anxiety then the flight to Bangkok took off late so we landed with under two hours till our next flight. I am extremely disappointed with the service I received with Emirates. The unexplained delays, unhelpful and rude staff in some cases, as well as missing our night in Bangkok was just not good enough. We were travelling for over 36 hours to Bangkok when we should have been there over 12 hours earlier. Whilst we appreciate that Emirates put us onto alternative flights to get to Bangkok we should have already been on the 11:45 flight as soon as our travel agent had contacted whilst we were still in Manchester.

No longer the comfortable journeys I had enjoyed previously. Service extremely poor and chaotic. No air hostess seemed to care in spite of pointing out several times. Disappointed to find no pre-dinner drinks or appetizers, but only a good-looking menu with a list of fancy items - not so delicious to eat, unfortunately. They missed serving me dinner while most of my fellow passengers were enjoying theirs. Had to call an exhausted air hostess twice, but all in vain. Got my dinner after 30 min when all my co-passengers finished eating. Drinks were very sparse, not offered more than once, coffees were cold and tasteless, and most foods were poor and stale - mostly carbohydrate-heavy with almost no green salads.

On my return flights an online offer popped up during the online check-in to upgrade to business class, but I got to upgrade for the first leg of the journey only - not the entire route as the offer disappeared on my second try (it gave me only one chance to upgrade). Not impressed with the business class kit-bag or other amenities. Couldn't sleep in the modernized recliner at all. Free business class lounge uses at Dubai airport were not offered in spite of buying an upgrade. I am sorry for Emirates that used to be one of the rare 5 star airlines. From Dubai to Athens to Newark, the rest of the journey was more like you would expect from a budget airline. Really disappointed, won't recommend to any friend or family, and will try to avoid in the future, unless a genuine offer is made.",5,15th January 2018,United States
910,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew from Kuala Lumpur to Rome via Dubai. The standard has declined drastically. The previous time I had flown with Emirates before this was in 2011 and it was fantastic, especially the food and service on board. Now, it is disappointing. The food selection was horrible. Snacks and drinks very sparse. The cabin crew took a long time to serve our meals. The Emirates lounge in Kuala Lumpur was not given to Economy passengers for free, unlike in 2011. The inflight entertainment was okay. Some headsets do not work. Flights were not punctual. There was a slight delay in all the flights throughout my journey with Emirates this time. Seat selection was not given for free (like some other airlines) for Economy Saver.",9,12th January 2018,Malaysia
911,"✅ Trip Verified | As I usually do I fly from Dubai using Emirates and I rarely change to other airlines. Flew from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur. The flight was very smooth, service was excellent and staff were very friendly. The only thing I suffered is that I was travelling with an infant (4 month old) and I couldn't get a front seat which provides a baby bed in front you but I cant blame them because I did the booking late and there was lots of kids and infants on this flight. However, the cabin crew checked us and ensured that we and baby were fine during the flight. Food was above average and I do like it. Coffee was warm but I would like to get it hot. Return flight was excellent and I got a front seat to accommodate my infant. Thanks Emirates. ",8,11th January 2018,United Arab Emirates
912,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairo to Basra via Dubai. The flight from Cairo to Dubai on 17 december arrived in a distant parking area and no buses were available. After running all B and C gates i reached C11 (to Basrah) with 4 minutes of delay.  The aircraft was there but the staff poor attitude was astonishing, she was unkind and refused me boarding. I had to wait 24 hours for another flight. ",1,11th January 2018,Egypt
913,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to San Francisco. I do not think this airline cares about its economy class passengers. This is a very long flight. Two hours into flight, they did not even provided a cup of water. They gave a food menu. That was a farce. Was it due to the flight attendants negligence or airlines policy. Food menu had two choices, yet when time came they told us only one item is available, like it or not. The item were half cooked. They should have told us that no food will be available. That way passengers could have made their own arrangements.",5,11th January 2018,United States
914,"✅ Trip Verified | Trivandrum to Seattle via Dubai. Recently I had a travel interstate in India in a volvo bus where the ticket was 600 per head and the push back seat gave full comfort of sitting and sleeping overnight during a 8 hours travel. Now I also had a recent international trip with Emirates in a flight where the ticket rate was 1,20,000 per head and the seating arrangement reminded me of cattle transportation that I have seen in India. Kindly consider that people travelling in Economy are also human beings and please understand that when we do 16-20 hours of journey, you can at least provide a proper push back seat which is comfortable.",4,10th January 2018,India
915,"✅ Trip Verified | Dubai to Colombo. Emirates stand as my preferred choice and the reason I pen these lines is to draw attention to a trend that seems to be slowly creeping in and lowering the standard. I travel economy as I have a back problem and feel more comfortable in the small harder seat sitting straight through a flight. My ticket was purchased in economy, I subsequently received a mail to state that I had been specially selected for an upgrade on a small payment. I did this only to offer the seat to my son, I later realized that most of the passengers had received the same message. This is actually a rip off as if I were to have bought a CCL ticket directly it would have cost me AED 3035/- here with the ug's it ended up a little more but minus the CCL benefits. Baggage, limo and lounge. Unlike several years ago when the crew looked stunning and of a better background today they seem to be quite poorly behind the uniform. Gone is that poise and flare. On my return journey the crew managed to tick me off with her carelessness and rudeness. If I had never travelled Emirates before it may have been my last. Food not to my liking, Crew - stay in your pantry. Regular seats limited pitch not suitable for the tall and well built. Inflight movies - great kept me busy. Tickets - great value for money but paid upgrade - should be avoided",3,8th January 2018,United Arab Emirates
916,"✅ Trip Verified |  Brisbane to Birmingham via Dubai. We flew on an overnight A380 Emirates flight from Brisbane to Dubai in late September, leaving Brisbane late at night. Flying time was 14 hours 20 minutes non-stop. This was sleeping time - I thought. I paid the extra $55 to select seats in economy for my wife and myself. I boarded and sat down to our long haul flight on a seat that was already broken. The recline wouldn’t lock in, and made an awful clunking noise whenever I moved the seat back or forward. After a few hours I had worked out that if I pushed back hard and held on with my feet and my back I could get the seat to recline. But as soon as I let the pressure off it immediately sprung back – in fact it sprung back past normal upright. You can imagine the result - 14 hours plus of long haul discomfort, battling with this seat! Naturally I couldn’t keep it up for the whole flight, and so after a few hours I sat upright – or past upright. Given that the seat in front was fully reclined, while mine was leaning forward, I couldn’t even put my head on the tray table. I mentioned the problem to the Emirates staff on board, but nothing could be done as it was a full flight, they said. So I left it at that. On our return home to Brisbane a month later I wrote to Emirates about the matter. They said that they would respond within 30 days, after they had gathered the facts. On day 30 I had no answer, so I prompted them for a reply. Yes, they eventually said in their response – the seat you selected was in fact broken on that flight - we knew about it as we had a logged report on it. Sorry to hear that you didn’t find the flight comfortable. (They obviously knew about the problem on the day that they received my email - but they deliberately held out responding for the full 30 days – hoping, no doubt, that I’d forget the matter.) They went on to say:- “Given that you had availed of the Advance Seat Reservation and paid AUD55.00 for the seat, we will be pleased to refund this charge to you. Kindly provide your bank details in order to process a bank transfer to your account….thank you for taking the time and trouble to write to us. ” That was it. If I had not paid $55 to select the seat – would Emirates have just written back (after 30 days) to say, sorry about your long uncomfortable flight in our broken seat, but too bad – nothing more we will do? If you are an economy class traveller like me, find an airline where passengers like you and me have had some genuine, and timely, resolution to their genuine issues. Don’t fly Emirates economy!

Had service light on requesting some water to take a tablet for over an hour had window seat so couldn’t get out - run out of food so was given a child’s meal option! Drinks very sparse and food poor! Worst airline for service I have flown with for some time, i must not forget however we got to Dubai and back safe but I am sorry Emirates the rest was more like you would expect from a budget airline!

918,"✅ Trip Verified |  Budapest to Colombo via Dubai. If I can name the most child hating airline, than Emirates must be the one. It was 4 flights but each and everyone was a nightmare. We travelled with our 1 year old son. He was offered food on 1 of the 4 flights only. We weren't asked even once if the baby is all right, if we need any help but we were harassed several times instead. The seats were uncomfortable and narrow, the on-flight entertainment hardly worked, once the screen was broken, once it was frozen and had to be restarted, once the console were broken, 3 different flights, 3 different problems. The utensils were dirty in the sealed pack and the food were terrible but hey it's economy so this would be least problem of ours. All in all the staff was probably the rudest it can be, we hardly met any kindness or smiles, although they cooled down the aircraft to something between 15 and 10 C degrees they arrogantly collected all the blankets way before landing so we almost frozen to death. At least it made us understand why some people are flying in winter jackets near the equator. There is no way we are going to use them again.",3,5th January 2018,Hungary
919,"✅ Trip Verified |  Kuwait to Dubai. I am a hesitant traveler on the Emirates, and this was the worst trip. The seats seemed narrow and the distance between them small. There is only one food category, entertainment programs did not contain anything new. The cabin staff were very kind, Wifi was free for one hour.",5,4th January 2018,Kuwait
920,"✅ Trip Verified |  Cairo to Singapore via Dubai.  Ground staff Ran out of fragile tags and was not willing to get it from other counters. During the serving of meals, it took an exceptionally long time before we were served and the steward did not provide us with the menu - only offered chicken option to us. When we probe further he mentioned that there is beef and chicken, so when we chose beef  the steward mentioned that there is only one beef option left. However I noted that in his tray there were many more beef packets in his trolley and he was serving beef options to others. ",4,3rd January 2018,Singapore
921,✅ Trip Verified |  Sydney to Dubai. It was my first time with Emirates and  the experience was negatively affected by the fact that 4 toilets of economy class where not functioning and closed. The economy class was full and people had to use the only 2 toilets functioning at the front of the cabin. Service was slow and affected by the fact that people needed to go through the attendants to go to the front toilets. At the end of the trip the toilets flooded.,10,3rd January 2018,Australia

923,"✅ Trip Verified |  Bologna to Bangkok via Dubai. My family and I missed the flight from Dubai to Bangkok, we did not hear any Last Call, but the thing that really disappointed me deeply was re-booking the flight, they put us in a waiting list for the first available flight and I had to queue in three different Office. The first confirmed the availability of the flight that would leave after an hour and sent me to the second to pay, after the payment sent me back to the first to collect the tickets, at the end after having lost more than half an hour for the queues the attendant told me to run to another gate to get the flight just paid or I would have lost it. It seemed absurd after paying €640, fortunately after 20 minutes of travel we arrived to the gate for catch the flight, it was a bad experience for me, my wife and my daughter, the ground service in Dubai was the worst ever.",1,1st January 2018,Italy
924,"✅ Trip Verified |  Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai in August 2017. During the flight the inflight entertainment did not work so it was a long flight. The crew tried to help and was nice. The cabin supervisor would make a complaint for us because she felt sorry. We never heard anything from Emirates. When we filed a complaint we never got a responses when why try to ask for information by Facebook of Twitter we only got standard answers always “file a complaint” what we already did. We even went to the Bangkok headquarters of Emirates. The lady there could not help all she said was, send us an e-mail. Why would you have a office in a city for help if you don’t help people? Emirates has declined from one of the best to one of the worst airlines in the world.",2,31st December 2017,Netherlands
925,"✅ Trip Verified |  Johannesburg to Manchester via Dubai. Although the four Emirates flights we took last month were good, the customer service for complaints is shockingly poor. On our return from Zimbabwe we had 3 flights in a day, 18 hours of flying, on our final 8 hour flight I decided I wanted to upgrade us to Business class. Firstly the website said there were no business class seats available, My live chat confirmed this. I then asked again in Johannesburg (8 hours before the flight I wanted business class flights for). Again I was told they were overbooked. When I asked I asked again in Dubai I was told, “yes, there are a few” just ask the cabin crew, which I did. I was told $1500 per person. This was three times the upgrade price I had been offered online! I mentioned this to the cabin crew who said they couldn’t help and that I should complain to customer service. After 25 days customer services replied a shockingly poor reply which just said “sorry” I was shocked and angered with this late and terrible response.

926,"✅ Trip Verified | Jakarta to London via Dubai. This is the first time I took Emirates, and definitely my last. Boarding began from Jakarta and the ground staff was courteous. In-flight, I don't really expect much because the cabin crew is generally not willing to go out of their way to get you your cup of coffee, especially on a busy morning flight. The cabin looks and feel tight, though I am neither tall nor fat. The seats? It isn't worth commenting. Landing in Dubai for the transit to London, expect the usual UAE approach. Their ground service is next to zero. The Emirates lounge is big but not fantastic, it's overcrowded if anything. Boarding my flight to London was ok, but once onboard, again, do not expect good service. Some cabin crew try to smile, that's about as good as you can get. Once the plane is cruising, they go on their ""switch-off"" mode (chit-chat, etc) more than they are willing to serve. Wifi and sleeping are about the only things that can keep you sane inside this flight. Needless to say, upon arrival to London and once I'm comfortably checked into my hotel room, I dumped the return leg for an SQ one. Emirates, my foot.",2,31st December 2017,Singapore

Food superb; braised steak with mashed potatoes leg one; roll then later omelette with potato croquettes and spinach later for leg two. Plenty of drink including wine as required. IFE superb; screen sensitivity better on leg 2. I like to watch a Japanese or Chinese film with English subtitles so I wasn't disappointed. Music section needs updating; annoying British man talking about Dubai when switching channels; advertising easy to avoid. Annoying Emirates theme music still randomly playing on occasions but volume lower than before which is good. Only a few interruptions into IFE; the one telling us how to use it 20 minutes into our usage is pointless trumpet blowing. Staff - superb on both legs. Wifi okay for text style messages but not streaming due to bandwidth issues.",1,30th December 2017,Malaysia

Disgusting customer service on the phone. I’ve been on hold for 30 min. Why not to call back? In the airport such a queue just to drop luggage at Emirates counter.

930,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Islamabad via Dubai. This was probably my worst experience ever with any airline I have ever traveled with. On my flight from London to Dubai, I was asked to move my stuff from my hand-carry to my check-in baggage and was charged a lot for the extra weight in my checked-in bag. Later, I had a layover at Dubai airport before my final destination. Just before boarding, the person at the gate charged me more than 150$ for my hand-carry again, when I told him specifically that I was charged at the London airport to move the weight to my checked in bag. The staff was extremely rude and apparently were even charging people who bought stuff from the duty-free shop. It seemed like Emirates was in desperate need of some extra cash. Since the flight was about to depart, nobody could really do much. There was a lot of anger and frustration. I was charged twice for almost the amount of a new ticket, and it did not make any sense. I am still unable to understand why and how the hand-carry at London airport that met the weight need (especially after moving the stuff to the checked in bag and paying for it) was charged again at the Dubai airport? In short, this really was my last time to choose Emirates to fly with. I am extremely disappointed in an airline that used to be one of my favorites. I will never use their services again.",1,30th December 2017,United States

With a 1-hour delay announced on the first flight (warning received by email a few hours before check-in), I thought the transit would be tight to be held. Contradictory information was given on the airport and by mail. We asked the ground staff, all they could say to us is ""no"". When finally our flight took off with a 2-hour delay, we thought we could not make it. Onboard, the crew did not want to listen to one single word from the passengers. All they could say to us is ""no"". When landing at Dubai, talking to the ground staff was of no use : all they could say to us is ""no"". So we ran to the boarding counter of the next flight. The plane was here, but we could not get inside. We waited 2 hours in Bangkok airport and the plane could not wait 15 minutes for the passengers to board, resulting in a final delay of 15 hours. We finally reached Paris the day after. Fortunately we could spend the night in a hotel.

The next meal that arrived (breakfast?) was a huge serving of lentils and more ratatouille so I decided to give that a miss and just take advantage of the pastries that were offered round instead.

I had to leave things at the gates before I was allowed to board. I wrote to customer service and although they apologised for the attitude and behaviour of their staff they were not clear about cabin luggage policy. In their own words “ I must point out that Emirates hand baggage allowance for Economy class passengers has always been one piece not exceeding 7kgs. Naturally, we allow reasonable quantities of duty free goods in addition to the above, however it would appear that the total weight off your hand luggage when reporting at the gate for your flight was exceeding your allowance”. I emailed them back asking for clarity about what reasonable quantity of duty free goods is but they had no explanation.  On board food was average with one meal served for this 7 Hour flight.

I noticed that the cabin crew don't communicate to each other or don't want to be there as a team. Food is normal and the IFE is excellent.

943,"✅ Trip Verified | My business journey from Germany to India took me more than 38 hours, thanks to a not acceptable miss from Emirates. Starting Sunday 10th December in Frankfurt/Germany I finally arrived Tuesday morining at 5 am in Hyderabad/India. For those who don´t know - this flight usually takes not more than 14 hours. It all started with a delay due to weather-conditions in Frankfurt. Well things like this happen, but sitting for more than two hours in the plane waiting for de-icing, Emirates weren't able to serve even a glass of water to passengers. The flight itself to Dubai was ok. In order to get the connecting flight to Hyderabad/India my colleagues and me were running through the airport and finally reached the gate right on time. Everything went fine, we even managed to be at the gate more than 30 min before gate-closing - that was my thought. Here the nightmare begins: At the check-in counter the supervisor told us that our seats had been already given away without any further explanation. This is something I can't understand, I also know from another colleague sitting on the plane that the flight even had free seats (in business as well as in economy). The supervisor told us to go to the customer service counter to raise our issue and clarify how to move on. This happens around 3 am in the morning. Obviously we were not the only one, there was a long lane of passengers at the counter. We were forced to wait more than 2 hours in a line, standing on our feet without seeing any Emirates-employees offering us water, food or just some friendly words. At their home-hub in Dubai? At this point in time around 5.30 in the morning, we were already tired and exhausted. After a long explanation to the service-employee, we managed to get a hotel and an alternative flight for the next evening. In order to check-in into the hotel we need to immigrate to Dubai (another 30min of waiting at immigration) and get a hotel voucher (another 30min of waiting at another Emirates counter). Than the hotel-shuttle was overbooked as well so we pay a taxi out of our pocket to get to the hotel. Next several misses. 7 am in the morning, we got welcomed by a long lane of grounded passengers waiting at the counter to check-in. Two hours later at 9 am in the morning I finally enter my room try to get some sleep. Summary: On a long distance journey things can take a turn for the worse due to delays and this is quite normal. But: I can't understand why they acted like this. There was no apology and the inconvenience was tremendously high. This was my first experience with Emirates and at the moment I am not looking forward for the flight back to Germany.",2,14th December 2017,Germany
944,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Hong Kong to Bangkok. Despite getting negatives review Emirates is getting these days, my flights to and from Hong Kong went so smoothly. On both flights crew were lovely, smiling and efficient. This A380 had the first class removed and replaced with economy in the front of the upper deck. A bit odd but makes good sense, as the lounge bar is at the back, cutting economy class at the back will not make sense at all. 20K is a lovely window bulkhead seat, feels really private, everything is perfect working order. Welcome drinks and hot towels, crew were cheerful and happy to engage in a little chit chat. Wifi is free and unlimited, if you are a skyward member travelling in business and first class, regardless of the tire level. Connection is fairly good throughout most of the flights. Meals were delivered with everything on one tray, nice presentation and good taste. Champagne and all kind of alcoholic drinks are plentiful and free flowing should you require. Both flights were under 3 hours, sweet but short. With such competitive price comparing to other airlines, I have no hesitation to choose EK on this route, and also to the Middle East and Europe.",2,13th December 2017,Hong Kong

I decided to take a couple of pictures and videos of the same to show the look of the lounge to my family. But an Indian flight attendant really rudely asked me to stop clicking pictures and said that if any crew member has been clicked to delete my videos as I can get involved into legal matters. This was embarrassing and humiliating for me as other crew members and passengers could hear this and started staring at us. He would not be wrong in saying this to me but there is a way of requesting for something. I went back to my seat and sat there for a while. I certainly didn’t expect this treatment especially from the Emirates crew after paying so much for the service of the business class, my husband being a gold class member.

I asked to speak to her supervisor and he said that was right, I’d have to pay. ‘Magnanimously’ he reduced the charge to half, 3kilos, which was £126. This is a right royal ripoff as I regularly send air parcels to Kenya for £4.25 per kilo.  I could not afford to leave any goods behind as I was traveling by myself. I was furious and paid the £126. One would think Emirates would want happy customers, but after paying £700 for my ticket and £1000 for my wife to follow me next week I was far from happy. Need to look next time I fly to an alternative airline. To be honest I’ve never found Birmingham Emirates check in very friendly, I feel like I’m being tolerated, not valued. Well the flight was no better, took off late and food took three hours to be served from takeoff, I’m a diabetic and starting to feel quite unwell by the time I got a choice of only one main course which is the usual mushy tray of stew-like substance. Dubai airport is nice but it’s a long trek to the gate followed by a long bus ride to the terminal. Food was again usual poor fare and just before landing a passengber sitting close to me vomited all over himself and he just sat there comatose. I assume he had been drinking before/during the flight and was blotto. There was no apology from cabin staff and although many passengers were retching from the smell onboard, no air fresher was brought by stewardesses! The visa and passport control in Nairobi was a fiasco and it took about an hour to get through although we still had to wait a long time for our baggage at reclaim. This was not a good trip!",1,10th December 2017,United Kingdom
948,"✅ Trip Verified |  I bought Two tickets for same route Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore and return Sydney to Colombo. At the purchased time System shows that I can earn about 43000 Tier and 48000 miles for each ticket. The first ticket I bought to travel in November and second for travel on February 2018. After I used first trip Colombo to Melbourne, before return from Sydney to Colombo I saw on Emirates Apps that the my Tier and miles cutting to half. After I make contact with Emirates, Asking I send any screenshot from miles was offered to me. I think no any one people think any airline want to cut or cheat to take any screenshot from miles. Just I keep my ticket and no miles shows in tickets. After I come back from first trip, I requested Emirates to see computers logs and later Emirates just said sorry was miles calculated in error. I asking supervisor to take look in my case and miles credited to my account for fist ticket. I requested to do same for second ticket. But until now I didn't find that emirates do for it. Many peoples compare routes and flights that can make more tier and miles for more benefits. So this is important for me to recover my Miles. I suggest to all taking full screenshots from any ticket and other documents may can show later to not cut or cheat anything by airlines.",10,10th December 2017,United States
949,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Emirates from Dubai to Manchester. Unfortunately I became unwell approximately 1.5hrs into the flight, reason unknown. However, can say the flight crew that looked after me in 68G went above and beyond with care, three ladies especially. They moved me to where I could lay down. I’m grateful for that, their care and kindness helped me to endure what was an awful experience. ",4,10th December 2017,United Kingdom
950,"✅ Trip Verified | London to Dubai inflight entertainment didn’t work and food very average. Durban to Dubai slightly better food, live footy was a nice touch. Return journey I upgraded to business class but was unable to use the lounge as this was a promo fare. Seat comfortable. Service good. Disappointing food once again and would not upgrade again. Dubai to London food ok all in all I wouldn’t rush back or recommend but not a lot of choices around to Durban",1,5th December 2017,United Kingdom
951,"✅ Trip Verified |  London to Melbourne via Dubai. Flight delayed in Dubai by over 3 hours because of an issue with the in-flight entertainment in First Class - nothing wrong with the aircraft and could have taken off on time. Flight delayed by over 2 hours arriving in Melbourne. When my husband tried to complain (he was the sole traveller in September), they gave him 15000 air miles. These have an expiry date. We did not want the airmiles, but Emirates would not entertain giving a full refund or partial refund. Very abrupt customer service. Apparently if he had not had Skyrewards, he wouldn't have got any compensation. Unfortunately we have booked for a family of 7 to travel with Emirates again next year to Australia. They are a shocking company. If anyone has any advice on what to do, I would be very grateful. Would never recommend them again. In addition - my 2 year old grand daughter has an egg allergy, when I told customer services this re. inflight meals, they told me it was my problem and to buy food for her at the airport. Maybe the CEO of Emirates needs to take a closer look at how this airline is being run and the attitude of the members of staff.",3,5th December 2017,United Kingdom
952,"✅ Trip Verified |  Glasgow to Dubai. Terrible seats that were tight and not good for sleeping, and the dullness of the cabin and the way the staff talk to you is terrible.

Still heard nothing back. Very poor and would not use this airline again!",2,3rd December 2017,United Kingdom
954,✅ Trip Verified | Milan to Dubai. I usually like Emirates but this time they really disappointed. The cabin crew was careless. The meal was bad and cabin crew didn't come when I called them just to get some water. Really disappointing but of course ICE (the on-board entertainment system) was impeccable. Flight was ok but Emirates' standards are higher than that.,9,2nd December 2017,United Arab Emirates
955,"✅ Trip Verified | New York to Mumbai via Dubai. Comfortable, clean and modern aircraft. In flight entertainment excellent. Food was decent and warm. Customer care is poor. The flight crew are running around doing whatever they feel. Most of the time they are sitting in the middle talking to each other. I have been flying internationally for last 15 years and this was the first time a crew member got upset when I made a request for water. In between meals no beverage provided. Even when meal service was being done, one of the stewardess rushed past everyone so that no one could order. This airline is not worth your money. Please spend a few more bucks and go to Qatar Airways where you will be respected as a human being or go cheap on Etihad as they are worth what you pay. Emirates no longer cares about its customers. I regret spending my money and keeping my expectations high with Emirates. Never will I fly them again.",3,2nd December 2017,United States
956,"✅ Trip Verified | The chauffeur service (always a Mercedes) and lounge provided in Delhi was great. The flight from Delhi to Dubai was uneventful at 4am except that the steward was helpful and smiling most of the time. That was a delight which was dampened by a remote bay arrival into busy Dubai. The lounge in Concourse A helps you board directly from the gate which is great. It is not as good though as the lounge in Concourse B. The flight to Toronto featured a new business class cabin on the upper deck with no overhead bins on the window side. The flight was full and the flight attendant, although tired at the fag end of 14 hours could not do enough. The bar was a superb place to hang out when I was tired sitting on the seat - and this leads to being overfed on even a long haul flight - you cannot stop picking at snacks at the bar. I did feel the seat/bed was a bit too tight (even though I am a relatively smaller person). The food and IFE continues to be outstanding. Also wifi is free for business class passengers and I was connected inflight almost all along. Arrival at Toronto airport was fuss free and it is a however a bit difficult to locate the chauffeur service at exit. Would definitely recommend the glamorous experience on Emirates.",9,1st December 2017,India
957,"✅ Trip Verified | Flew Emirates from Karachi to Jeddah via Dubai. Best airline in the world and the Gulf. Emirates offer the best cuisines onboard and have the most comfortable economy class seats. Inflight entertainment system cant be described in words, it was excellent and it had all movies of our native country. The crew were also very friendly.",3,29th November 2017,Pakistan
958,"✅ Trip Verified | I have been flying with Emirates for 6 years as they offered good customer service, and did not sell exit row seats. No longer it seems. I recently booked a flight from London to Denpasar via Dubai, only to find after paying for the flight that Emirates now charge for exit row seats, in this case an additional £150. I immediately called Emirates to discuss this to see if anything could be done. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats, pay a £100 cancellation fee or email customer services. I emailed customer services highlighting that it is poor customer service and even worse business process to not show the potential full price of the flight until after the customer has booked and requested a fair and reasonable solution. The representative said my options were to pay for the seats or pay a £100 cancellation fee. Shame Emirates. Emirates did not show the full price and are using a misleading process that sells a ticket without showing the potential full price. Even easyJet and Ryanair show users the full price of their tickets before purchase! Emirates used to be a company that put customers at the heart of the business. I guess now it is just money.",1,28th November 2017,United Kingdom
959,"✅ Trip Verified | Emirates appear to be upgrading a lot of Economy passengers to Business. At check in the Business Class was only partially occupied on the Madrid-Dubai segment, indeed a few days before check in occupation was very sparse. On the day of travel it was almost full. So where did all the passengers suddenly appear from? I can only guess that they were upgrades, unless Emirates are bulk selling Business seats at lower prices through bucket shops. In either case, it seems extremely unfair on people like myself who have paid full price out of our own pocket, since the service for so many passengers is obviously not as good and why should I have to pay three times as much as my neighbour for the same seat? To add insult to injury, Madrid and Barcelona are Emirates' most expensive business class departures cities in Europe. Example Madrid Australia return is 5000 euros + from Madrid but less than 4000 euros from Paris or London. Having paid above the odds and then to see an invasion apparently from Economy Class is simply insulting.",7,28th November 2017,Spain
960,"✅ Trip Verified |  Dubai to Zurich. Our flight to Zurich departed on time and we were warmly welcomed by the crew, who provided a very attentive and excellent service on a full flight. The spacious cabin and very comfortable seat made it also a very relaxed flight. The food and drinks were again of very high standard.  The chauffeur service during my trip was excellent, always punctual, and the service made travelling very smooth! I was provided with an exceptional good service by very friendly and caring cabin crew. I always felt very welcomed and very well looked after. In the past I had flown Emirates in Economy (which had also been a very positive experience) and did not regret for one moment choosing them for flying business.",4,28th November 2017,Switzerland
961,"✅ Trip Verified |  Melbourne to Auckland Due to a medical emergency on the incoming flight from Dubai, the flight from Melbourne to Auckland was delayed by 4 hours. Emirates did sent a text message well ahead of the originally scheduled departure so there was no need to rush to the airport. I waited in the very comfortable Emirates Lounge and the ground staff kept us well informed about the new planned boarding time. Boarding processed smoothly and the crew on this flight was fantastic. They provided an exceptional service and made me feel very welcome. They were just the best! Auckland to Dubai Boarding again was smooth and the flight departed on time. I looked forward to one of the longest non-stop flights on the A380 and I was not disappointed. A very friendly crew provided a superb service from start till the end of this long journey. Dinner was served not too late after departure so that we could settle in for a good sleep. The meal options and wine offerings were again fantastic. For those still feeling hungry, there were additional options of warm and cold snacks available and prepared throughout the flight by the crew. Also, there were plenty of hors d'oeuvres on offer at the bar. The brilliant inflight entertainment system helped to ease any boredom on this long flight. Given the length of the flight, we arrived well ahead of schedule in Dubai.",1,27th November 2017,Switzerland
962,"✅ Trip Verified |  Zurich to Melbourne via Dubai. I was punctually picked-up by the chauffeur drive service, and had a smooth check-in and quick transfer through customs & security to the lounge. Boarding commenced on time and I was welcomed by a very friendly and helpful cabin crew. The crew was very attentive and provided excellent service throughout a full and very busy flight. My window seat was very comfortable with lots of legroom and also a small little mini bar with soft drinks, which were replenished throughout the flight. The food offered on board was excellent and Emirates' wine list is of very high quality. Both food and wine offerings were very generous. The inflight entertainment system is the best and has a fantastic selection of movies, shows and music. The A380 is a wonderful plane to fly in, very quiet, spacious and the bar of course is one of the highlights. Overall, I had a great flight. After a 3 hour break I was due to board the connecting flight to Melbourne. Fog in Dubai though caused a delay but we were kept well informed by ground staff and once boarding started it was smooth. The A380 cabin as well as the service in this very busy flight (full business class) was again fabulous. Maybe just something trivial, but I loved that one could adjust the window blinds individually by pressing the respective buttons. The free inflight wifi in business class is brilliant and I enjoyed keeping in touch with friends along the trip. I managed to sleep for most of the flight and after a light breakfast (there are various breakfast options available, I decided to choose the lightest version) we landing in Melbourne.",1,27th November 2017,Switzerland
963,"✅ Trip Verified | Not close to what we expected. We now understand why Emirates is not number 1 anymore. We are frequent travellers going to various locations, always Economy. The flights with Emirates from Frankfurt to Male via Dubai and same way back were pretty ""interesting"". On all flights we were pretty confused that the blankets we used to keep us warm were taken away before landing, same counts for the earphones. (We had our own but even them they wanted to take away, crazy). The Cabin crew was not pretty helpful and especially soft drinks were not offered often enough, even on request we were simply ignored, maybe because of being Economy guests. Highlight was that the cabin crew lady poured me with Mango juice and did not even say a word. The food experience was average, other airlines offer much better food from a quality perspective and also from the options you have. Entertainment was pretty good.",1,27th November 2017,Germany
964,"✅ Trip Verified |  Lyon to Bangkok via Dubai. A horror, expensive for a shabby delivery. In the devices (4 in total) we had only trouble, error of seats, headphones that do not work, screen that does not work, lack on the meal trays, we even had a power cut on our row of seats, and damaged luggage on arrival! And the staff is completely dabbing, no matter what your request, it's always ""no"" ""we can not"" ""we'll see"", never seen people who had so much nothing to do, even for luggage! Une horreur, cher pour une prestation minable. Dans les appareils (4 au total) nous n'avons eu que des ennuis, erreur de sièges, écouteurs qui ne fonctionnent pas, écran qui ne fonctionnent pas, manque sur les plateaux repas, nous avons même eu une coupure d'électricité sur notre rangée de sièges, et bien sûr, bagages endommagés à l'arrivée, SURRÉALISTE ! Et le personnel s'en tamponne complétement, peu importe votre demande, c'est toujours ""non"" ""on peut pas"" ""on va voir"", jamais vu des gens qui en avaient autant rien à faire, même pour les bagages !",7,27th November 2017,France
965,"✅ Trip Verified |  Frankfurt to Bangkok via Dubai. I understood from the crew that Emirates has a new policy to overbook the economy class and upgrade all remaining passengers to Business class. That is what happened on the both mentioned flights, more than 50% passengers got free upgrades to Business. So C class was totally full on the huge A380 results in poor service because the FAs were totally overloaded with this high amount of people. On the flight from Frankfurt to Dubai I had to wait more than 3 hours until they served the dinner. Further I think this is also very unfair for the passengers who paid the business class fare. It seems that the airline is good for economy passengers but sorry Emirates this is not what business people paying a very high fare do expect.",2,25th November 2017,Germany
966,"✅ Trip Verified |  Zürich to Phuket via Dubai. I had high expectations since I  heard that Emirates should be very good, but I was very disappointed. The customer service was terrible. I am not sure they even know what it means. The stewardesses had a very arrogant, superior attitude which I found just low and disgusting. As they went down the aisle they went with hard steps as if they wanted all attention on themselves. One time a stewardess was serving drinks and as she presented the tablet with the drinks, my boyfriend wanted to take the tray to make it easier to take our drinks. Then she said in not such a friendly tone; ""Just take the drinks please."" Not politeness, no smile. I don't know if they are able to smile, because we didn't see much of it. They may think that the red lipstick makes them look nice, but a smile is way more beautiful. Another time a stewardess was serving food and drinks and as she came to our row I looked up. Then she said in an arrogant tone; ""Hold on please"", then walked away and came back a little later. I hadn't said anything to her. At the end of a flight a man came to collect all the headphones. I gave mine to my boyfriend so he could give it, because he sat by the aisle. He gave it to the man and a little later the man asked for the headphones, not in a nice way and with no smile. My boyfriend then told him he had already given it. He just looked and then went on. No apology, which one would actually expect. When you work in the service business you cannot act all arrogant and superior, because then you lose customers which you are dependent on to receive salary. They obviously didn't learn what I learned as I was working in the service business. That the customer is the boss. Another thing was that as we boarded the plane, it reeked of perfume, which was just very nauseating to be honest. Very disappointing was also on the flight from Dubai to Phuket as my boyfriend and I didn't get to sit together even though we had booked as a couple. We were told that if there were some available seats in the back that we could maybe sit together. The stewardess never came. My boyfriend then saw that there were some available seats in the back and we asked a stewardess if we could sit there. Then she said that no, these seats are for the cabin crew to sit down for breaks. Uhm, what? I have never experienced that the cabin crew is sitting with the rest of the passengers. So this was very odd. The food was ok, the entertainment was not to be complained about, but the rude, unfriendly, arrogant cabin crew just ruined everything for me. I have this to say to those arrogant stewardesses; ""Get over yourselves and get down from your high horse, you are not better than anyone."" So I will not be travelling with Emirates again, and I will certainly not recommend it to anyone I know, quite the contrary actually.",8,24th November 2017,Switzerland
967,"✅ Trip Verified |  Newark to Athens on Boeing 777-300 in Business Class. Emirates is a better airline than any US carrier but it aspires, it says, to be the best airline in the world. It is far from that.My flight was delayed due to some issue of getting our aircraft to the gate. The information about this delay was non-existent at check-in. I found out about the delay only after the agent in the SAS Lounge (who doesn't work for Emirates) told me about it.  Eventually, we were told the flight was boarding. We left to discover nothing of the sort. The gate area was chaos. The flight was not boarding, not even close. The employees, about 6 in number, were glued to their smart phones texting and surfing. I would fire every last one of them. They made infrequent and irregular announcements, with incorrect information. The boarding time kept getting moved. The employees sat on their phones. Finally, we started to board. Well, not the Premium passengers. First, the people traveling needing extra assistance and with children. Eventually, Business class boarded, but only after an Emirates person line jumped with a group of passengers in front of us. Once on board, I encountered a seat with a non-functional small video screen that is used to control the seat! Fortunately, the seat next to me was empty. The seat is not the standard these days. Angled lie flat is so 1980. Middle seats in Business Class? Are you kidding, Emirates? Whoever made this decision should be fired. The wine list contained one champagne (good selection) and two whites (one a dismal CA Chardonnay, the other a nice Sancerre) and two reds (one a pedestrian Oregon Pinot and one a 2007 Bordeaux that was quite nice). This selection pales in comparison to Qatar. Food quality was very good, although the crew wanted to rush me through the meal. I didn't let them. Eventually, they adjusted. Crew service was spotty. At times personal and nice, and at times missing or impersonal. The inflight entertainment is extensive but the system is CLUNKY to use and the endless ads before any movie is irritating beyond belief. It is also very hard to scroll quickly through the movie options. They are also poorly organized into categories, in my opinion. For the money, Qatar is a far better airline with a truly premium treatment for people in premium classes. Better seats, friendlier crews, better wine, and an overall better experience is available on Qatar. Emirates has a lot of work to do.",10,23rd November 2017,United States

Great experience, very polite staff, great food served twice on a long flight and arrival on time even after leaving Dubai late. The departure from Dubai was a very painful experience however - 400+ passengers queuing in front of a gate that was showing ""boarding"" while boarding hadn't started.

Lots of leg room, excellent cabin lighting and temperature, lots of room to walk around, and excellent inflight entertainment. A database of around 500 movies in many languages is available. You can connect your device by USB and listen to your music or watch your own movies on the bigger screen. Large windows and 3 flight cameras available all the time. In flight service reminds me of the old days when we had nice meals on planes served with metal cutlery. Inflight wifi with 20MB free of charge and mobile phone connectivity for calls. Brilliant.",10,22nd November 2017,United Kingdom
971,"✅ Trip Verified | Boeing 777-300ER (A6-EBL) was very difficult 5.5 hours from Dubai to Hanoi. The seats are very narrow and leg room is nonexistent, especially if the person in front of you decides to recline the seat. Furthermore, there is a box of equipment under the front seat, further reducing room for your feet, so you can't even stretch your legs as the comfort video tells you to. I know Emirates have a few configurations for the 777, it seems they put the condensed seats on the Asian routes, profiling the average body size of the passengers. Very disappointing for Emirates. IFE is standard Emirates with many movies and options but on a very small and badly lit screen, old fashioned equipment.

This was agreed, confirmed and confirmed again at check in where they advised it had not been added. On boarding the aircraft when those needing time/assistance were asked to board I found myself behind at least 10 able bodied passengers jumping the queue. To add insult to injury, after getting on board, the stewardess then made me wait while one of these able bodied passengers messed around for 5 minutes. When I did get to my seat, I had spent that long standing and queuing that I was in a lot of pain. Thanks Emirates. Arriving in Dubai where I was supposed to be assisted, again there was no help and I had to struggle across the airport in pain.

At Delhi airport, I was three hours early ready to get on board but some  employee told me to stand in line to get checked in. They didn't properly guide us or let us board the flight. The line was extremely long and it took me 1.5 hours to get checked in. I discussed my issues with one of the employees and told him I am not happy with the service. His response was very poor and he seemed to not understand the issue. On the flight to Delhi, we requested an Asian meal but they denied to gave us an Asian meal on the flight, which I found very strange. After reaching Dubai, the security man was asking so many question and checked my handbag very vigorously. I asked the security guy why he was being so aggressive with my belongings and he explained to me my boarding password code was ""SSSS"", which means they have to check your body and bag very seriously. The flight from Dubai to JFK was better, but again, they failed to serve us any Asian vegetarian food. I will not be flying with this airline in the future.",3,21st November 2017,United States
974,"✅ Trip Verified | Unforgettable experience flying with Emirates from Singapore to Rome via Dubai. I was booked on flight EK433, with scheduled departure on Friday at 9.35am but was notified last minute via text message at 4.23am that I had been put on EK353 departing at 10.10am instead. To make things worse, that flight was delayed for another 1 hour 10 minutes. I didn’t know if I was traveling with Emirates or a budget airline that cancels flights on a whim. By the time I arrived in Dubai, my original 2 hour connection time had become less than 40 minutes. Ground staff in Dubai did not offer any form of assistance in making my connecting flight. I made it to the departure gate 5 minutes before closing time only to be told I had been offloaded from the plane. At no stage was I notified that I would be bumped from my connecting flight because of shorter than “minimum connection time” thanks to Emirates’ brilliant incompetence in punctuality. After some argument with the ground staff at the gate, I managed to get onto the flight with the supervisor granting me an act of grace, when it’s Emirates which had sinned. But his grace did not extend to my checked in baggage however, which will only arrive with the next flight. Arrangement to make delivery of my delayed baggage was made immediately after clearing immigration on arrival in Rome FCO airport Friday at 6.40pm, when I was assured my luggage would arrive following day. I even received an email saying my bag will arrive in Rome at about 12.40pm on Saturday. Little did I know I would be slapped in my face with Emirates’ commitment to punctuality again. When I haven’t received my bag at 5pm, I rang the baggage office, and was advised it had just cleared customs and would be delivered in the evening. 6 hours later I was still waiting, and followed up with another less than pleasant phone call. Upon which, the only solution they could offer is the contact number of the local baggage delivery agent. No, of course their gilded fingers can’t possibly dial the number to follow up on a customer’s delayed baggage. I finally received my bag on Sunday at 12.15am. Hooray for a change of clothes finally.

The Boeing 777 really could use a facelift to be honest - you go from comfort on the A380 to feeling like your on a 4 hour bus ride in the sky. It is very cramped and could be configured better to help both passengers and the airline.,6,17th November 2017,Australia
978,"✅ Verified Review |  I was traveling with my wife from Tokyo to Dubai on the 3rd of November EK319 we prebooked extra leg room seats which was an emergency exit for 95$ per seat because it’s a 12 hours flight, 80H this was my seat. First the crew were very noisy all the flight especially that we were beside the kitchen, they were bumping us, our legs, heads even our screens every time all over the flight putting the food & wine boxes in front of us like a storage area which also hit our legs and putting the wine boxes on the emergency exit door which is not complying with the safety regulations. We complained and the crew told us that they always tell the company about these seats that it has a problem and they don’t believe them so please complain when you reach Dubai, nothing we can do it’s a full flight no place to change. We stayed for 12 hours we couldn’t even sleep for 1 hour from the noise of the crew it was the worst flight ever. When we went back to Dubai we went to the service center to complain about the flight experience they told us we don’t have complain system you only can complain online by email. We sent our complain and wrote all the details and even the safety issues that was not applied during the flight & unfortunately they came back to us after two weeks with nothing. The flight was the worst flight experience and the customer service was disaster in case of handling our complains We paid extra money for noisy seats with untrained crew that no nothing about service treating our seats as if it’s a storage area and know nothing about safety guidelines.",7,16th November 2017,Egypt
979,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Auckland. This was my second trip on this route with the same airline, and the biggest difference was the service from the Cabin Crew. The morning started with a visit to the Emirates Lounge, an excellent decision. Boarding once again was chaotic, no specific lines indicating Economy, Business or First. No one knew where to go and the Ground Team just did nothing to put order in place. When we were airborne, the onboard service started and I immediately felt the FA's were not as personal compared to my previous experience. The all seem too busy with getting the job done, rather than taking the time to engage with passengers. Food and beverages were average, though the portions can definitely increase in size. The seat was comfortable and, with blankets and pillows distributed to all passengers. On a good note, the IFE was fantastic as the amount of content can keep you entertain for hours. Overall, customer satisfaction really needs to be evaluated.",4,15th November 2017,Australia
980,"✅ Verified Review |  This was our first flight using Emirates from Glasgow to Sydney via Dubai and it will be our last. We were looking forward to flying Emirates as it had the reputation of being a luxury airline with adverts showing courteous attendants there to serve their customers with a smile. The reality was quite the opposite. The flight attendants were sullen and rude with very poor customer service. The staff at the boarding gate were quite cheery, laughing and smiling amongst themselves until it was time for the passengers to board. We met with dour stony faces - no smile, genuine welcome or attempt at being polite. We felt more like an inconvenience. Once on board we were in the air for 2 hours before any drinks were offered. Again no pleasantries just quite abrupt service. The meal was ok but breakfast after a 7 hour flight was a 2 finger shortbread biscuit. The return leg was no better, in fact worse. We experienced the same sullen attitude from the staff with the addition of an air of superiority as they marched up and down the aisle, and woe betide anyone in their way. If we happened to be standing in the aisle they would barge passed, no excuse me or waiting for you to get something out your bag. Meal service was again slow and very sloppy. The attendant spilled hot fat from the breakfast dish over my white trousers. She did get some cloths but the stains haven’t come out. The other attendant passed a hot meal over my head to my husband - are they not taught how to serve customers? We were given blankets but these were collected long before the end of the flight. The final “thank you for flying Emirates” sounded matter of fact and so insincere. On the return we missed our connection from Brisbane to Dubai due to bad weather and were put on the next flight which was 8 hours later at 5am. We were given food vouchers but they turned out to be useless as all the shops were shut. Apart from a couple of cleaners the airport was empty. When we explained to the staff when the desk opened they showed no interest and no sign of concern for their customers’ comfort. This is by far the worst airline I have ever flown with, even the cheap budget airlines have a more respectful attitude towards their customers. Next time we fly to Australia we will use Singapore Airlines again - far superior.",9,13th November 2017,United Kingdom
981,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Perth via Dubai. It is 10 years since we last used Emirates on this route, and they have really gone down the budget airline path since then. Plane to Perth looked worn and quite dirty in the cabin, staff service bordered on downright rude and those serving our seating area clearly had some issues about having to work. Dubai Airport has assumed the role of a large, characterless giant warehouse and the airport staff for Emirates seem to delight in shouting at passengers, and showing contempt to all. I admit the tickets were really cheap and now I realise that Emirates is going down the budget airline path with what they provide. Can only assume they have financial problems to have cut back so much on what they once provided.",2,11th November 2017,United Kingdom
982,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Cairo. Emirates has become mass transit in their economy class. People are herded like cattle, the plane is crammed with little room and the staff is overworked as usually 100% of seats are occupied. Probably great for their bottom line but it’s not anymore a special airline. It gets you from A to B safely and there’s nice entertainment. That’s it.",4,11th November 2017,Egypt
983,"✅ Verified Review |  Barcelona to Melbourne via Dubai.  We were looking forward to flying with Emirates - we hadn't flown with them before and had heard good things. But unfortunately the customer service (or lack thereof) from the Flight Attendants onboard both flights was atrocious. I have written over a month ago to the Emirates Feedback form on their website but have not had any response - perhaps they are overwhelmed with complaints? For a start, none of the staff seemed to be smiling or happy. I didn't really think anything of it at first until I realised how uncomfortable I felt with the sour faces around me. About an hour into the flight I thought I would use the restroom. I was on the left side of the plane in an aisle seat, row 56. I had seen other passengers walking up and down the aisle using the restrooms and so I walked forward too, where I could see the toilet sign. A male flight attendant asked me where I was going? I said, ""To the toilet. I'm going to the restroom."" He shouted, ""Back! Get back. Go back!"" and flung his arm towards the back of the plane. I was shocked at his attitude and aggression that I returned to my seat. He came over to me and said, ""You can use the toilet at the back of the plane."" I explained that I had seen other people moving freely around the plane and that I felt he had spoken to me incredibly rudely. He said I could use the toilet towards the front if I wanted. I have no idea how many international and domestic flights I have been on in my 48 years, but I have never been spoken to like that - with so little provocation!  The other flight attendants were equally rude; no communication or attempt at being polite or friendly. An hour and a half before we landed in Dubai they literally pulled blankets off people and demanded headsets and were more concerned with shoving all the blankets into the toilet cubicles than with the passengers waiting to use the restrooms. Many of the passengers in Dubai were talking about how rude the flight attendants had been and why they had to take blankets and headsets from people so early? Unfortunately they were not much better from Dubai to Melbourne. Again, no smiles, no warmth - they would say ""Drink?"" with raised eyebrows (no smile) and when I would say, ""An orange juice please,"" they would place it onto a tray and just shove the tray into my face without a word. Literally into my face. I am writing because I had heard good things about Emirates - but the flight attendants have really let the company down.  On a long haul flight, the last thing customers need (we who are paying their wages!) is such surly faces around us. We are not doing you a favour by being on the plane!",2,8th November 2017,Australia
984,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Mauritius via Dubai. Ruined the start of our honeymoon. Flight from London was delayed by around 30 minutes which meant we missed our connecting flight, no apology from anyone and we were moved to a flight that was 6hrs 15mins later than our original one which meant we had to wait in Dubai airport for 7 hours.  Emirates staff were really unhelpful and did not compensate customers in any way, apart from a cheap meal voucher. Will never fly with Emirates again. Terrible experience.",2,8th November 2017,United Kingdom
985,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Mumbai. Food served extremely late just before 1 hour landing time though the flight duration was about 3 hours. No drinks before except water. We were in seatsr 84J/84K in zone C. Til our food was being served non veg food over. They served veg food. I asked for mango juice. No juice. Juice also over. Instead they served orange juice. Til i complete my dinner it was almost landing time. No time to eat properly or appreciate the food.,2,7th November 2017,Mauritius

987,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Perth. I initially travelled from Cairo to Dubai on EK 924 for which I gave an excellent review! But the flight to Perth was terrible. Staff were not even friendly nor were they interested in their passengers. I asked for a seatbelt extension and this flight attendant stood two seats away asking me to repeat what I’d said before she very unhappily went to fetch one. I did not have breakfast however lunch arrived with the Hostess telling us chicken on the menu would be 15 min late well that never arrived nor did an apology from Staff. They were standing behind the curtain and eating snacks no concern for their passengers or if they attended we felt like a nuisance so dare not ask. I tried to write a review online but that wasn’t working either. All in all they were the most miserable flight attendants I’ve ever travelled with! We only heard from the Captain and that was it! The flight itself was uneventful!,7,6th November 2017,Australia
988,"✅ Verified Review |  Newark to Athens. Emirates far exceeds the services provided by US carriers. I needed to change my travel dates due to a family emergency, and the ticket agent waved the change fees, allowing me to depart for Athens within the day. The service on board both ways included two full meals, nice reusable amenity kits with shades, earplugs, socks and toothpaste/toothbrush, the seats were comfortable, and the bar service featured top-shelf brands. The in-flight entertainment system was also top notch, with cameras built in to the front of the plane to provide you with a cockpit view. Economy passengers are also offered a certain amount of free wifi, which was more than enough to communicate with friends and family on the ground to inform them of my flights progress. If all of that is not enough, Emirates allows economy passengers to check in 2 bags for free!",1,4th November 2017,United States
989,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Glasgow via Dubai. Very impressed with cleanliness, food, service and the pleasant way the cabin crew dealt with some downright stupid and rude travelers. From checking in to leaving the aircraft staff were very professional and pleasant. We misplaced one of our mobile phones and was returned to us within 24 hours. Impressive. ",7,2nd November 2017,United Kingdom
990,"✅ Verified Review | The positives for Emirates is to do with the aircraft, as the A380 offers comfortable seats with adequate legroom. The list of negatives is quite big: - Crew members didn't bother to assist during embarkation resulting a really slow process. Even worse, when most passengers had to look for available cabinets to store their luggage nobody from the crew members even bothered to pretend to be interested and assist. Passengers who wanted their dinner to be accompanied with wine or beverage had to wait more than 20 minutes to be served. Long, literally long, queues at lavatories. Crew didn't assist at all. I do understand that when the not to be disturbed sticker has fallen from the seat, crew will try to wake you up in order to serve breakfast. Still that should not reach the stage where they will literally poke you and scream close to your ears. They could either open the folded tray and leave it there or let you a note that they didn't serve because you were sleeping. Having two options for dinner (when you promote yourself as top carrier) is quite limited. Saying that you have two options for dinner when the number of available portions of one is small compared to the overall number of passengers (particular flight was almost fully booked) is laughable. Some people do not eat chicken (sounds strange but I do not eat it), I can understand that due to any reasons you are out of beef (actually I do not understand it but anyway) but that does not mean that you have to force me to get your chicken dish and refuse (actually they did not refuse, just didn't bother to reply and moved on) to take it back. Cabin wifi is great as an idea. If only someone could say how to activate it on economy class.",2,1st November 2017,Cambodia
991,"✅ Verified Review |  Cairo to Dallas via Dubai. The flight from Dubai to DFW takes approx. 16 hours, I was at seat 37 A. After take off from Dubai at 3am a meal was served, and then for approx 13 hours passengers are left without any meals only a small piece of pizza. Three hours before landing another meal was served. After the first meal normally passengers go to sleep for 3-6 hours, a meal should be served after 7 hours from take off and then the last meal 2-3 hours before landing. ",3,31st October 2017,Egypt
992,"✅ Verified Review | We are terribly concerned and quite upset with both the quality and quantity of the onboard meals on long distance Emirates flights. In our recent experience, there was only one meal served during our flight from Manchester to Dubai which lasted for 7 hours 30min. A tiny packet of pretzels was provided as a snack which was very inadequate and compares poorly to any other airline. There were also no sleeping kits provided which is highly unusual. On the Dubai to Kolkata flight (duration of 4 hours), the only meal provided came very late and we had to request for snacks (which were tiny packets of savoury mix) to fill in. Not to mention, the meals they provided in both flights were frugal and by far of a poor quality in comparison to any standard airline. Desserts were horrendous. We dread boarding our already booked return flight back to Manchester.",5,29th October 2017,United Kingdom
993,"✅ Verified Review |  New York JFK to Milan. As 400 passengers deplaned in Milan there were only two customs agents available for non European Union passengers. Poor planning to say the least. It took well over an hour to clear customs. By the time I tried to obtain my luggage it was missing. There was no one to check and see if the baggage removed belonged to the owner. What is the use of giving a baggage claim if it is ignored. Thus It is very easy to steal luggage from the airport in Milan. I had to rent a car for an additional day drive 100K to and from Verona, find a physician and obtain needed medications and clothes.One day of my vacation wasted. After 3 days I was informed that my baggage was found in Rome and that it would be sent to Venice where I was now staying. Emirates would not deliver it to my hotel and I had to go to the trouble and expense of traveling to the Venice airport to pick up my luggage. The second day of my vacation wasted. After obtaining my bag I was informed by Emirates that it would take at least 4 weeks to respond to my complaint. I’m sure that they just wanted me to have finished my travels to respond so that they would not have to upgrade my return travel. After 6 weeks I received a form letter that hid behind the Montreal protocol to tell me that they would pay for the clothes that I had purchased. No addressing of any issues or answer to any of my questions. My expenses and inconvenience went far beyond obtaining new clothes and Emirates which touts itself as “the greatest” fell short in its response. I cannot recommend any airline which will not enter into a dialog with an unhappy customer, address its shortcomings and fairly compensate a customer for its failures.",4,26th October 2017,United States
994,"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Manchester via Dubai, returning from Paris. We have traveled with Emirates Business Class many times in the past and although not perfect, we have never had cause for complaint until now. We traveled to Manchester from Perth on 4th September 2017. Our flight to Manchester was uneventful. However, the walk (including train) to our connecting flight (EK19) was horrendous. It took at least 30 minutes to get from Terminal 3 to Terminal 1. Considering there is no significant layover time between flights, if the incoming flight from Perth had been delayed, we would have missed the Manchester flight. Another passenger who was also on the same flights looked quite ill from the strenuous walk. Many UK ex-pats live in Perth and would have been connecting to the Manchester flight, why was this flight from Terminal 1 and not terminal 3? The experience on our return flight flights was even worse. The service and food on the flight from Paris to Dubai from 30th September 2017 (EK76) was unacceptable. Food was cold (soup) and a steak that I ordered was uneatable. I asked for a glass of wine with my dinner and this did not materialise until 30 minutes after I had finished my meal. Seats were also very uncomfortable. Once again a walk and train for our flight to Perth (EK424). When the flight was eventually called we were subjected to being herded on a bus for a 10 minute drive to the plane and then had to climb a staircase to board. I have had a better embarkation experience with AirAsia and this is totally unacceptable for an airline of Emirates reputation. The flight arrived in Perth over an hour late, obviously due to the embarkation process. With the exception of the return flight from Dubai to Perth (EK424) food on all other sectors was mediocre at best and unacceptable at worst. The business class lounge in Dubai was as useful packed to the rafters and quite uncomfortable. The highlight of the flight was the food and service in the Emirates Paris Business Lounge. It is a shame that Emirates cannot maintain this consistency of service and cuisine across all flight services. We travel Business Class to Europe at least once every year and more often than not with Emirates. Given the above experience, it will be hard to choose Emirates as our carrier in the future.",2,23rd October 2017,Australia

Some of the best airline food I've had, the flight attendants came around regularly with a tray of drinks and pretzels. Snacks of pizza, fruit and chocolate bars.

My flight landed in time at JFK airport but due to some traffic problem we were forced to stay onboard for almost an hour. By that time my connecting JetBlue flight was missed. I am a wheelchair candidate and airport guys just dumped me at an empty JetBlue gate. I was trying to get in contact with Emirates office, not able get on phone at that time. So I called JetBlue and was forced to book 2 only available tickets for next day. As I was waiting , I tried again Emirates office and they agreed to book the the same ticket which I booked for. But I had to cancel the ticket which I booked myself, cost me $100. It was so awful that I had to stay at airport 15 hrs more sitting on a single chair, after 14hrs flight. It is insane!

999,"✅ Verified Review |  Glasgow to Auckland return via Dubai. This journey involved the very long-haul flight, DXB-AKL. No particular issues - both journeys (16.5h eastbound / 17h westbound) went quite well. But this was only because we were flying the sector in an A380; I would not recommend a flight of this length in a 10-seat-across B777 (or a 9-seat-across B787), because these aircraft would be too cramped. The A380 is still as excellent an aircraft to fly in as ever. On the return service, the flight itself had very few passengers (<100), so the service was excellent. As for the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777 is tolerable, but only just (both flights were pretty full). I like flying Emirates. I would like them more if the Glasgow leg could be upgraded to an A380.",10,17th October 2017,United Kingdom
1000,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Dubai. Inconsistent service is rampant on Emirates - both onboard and on ground! The check in agent in Delhi was polite and offered us to give up seats for an overbooked flight which we denied. The check in agent at Dubai was downright pathetic and rude; no smiles and even threatened us with charges for extra weight in hand carry later prior to boarding (none of that happened). This impolite behaviour is meted out to passengers with status, surprisingly. Boarding at both airports was smooth and by zones. The aircraft sent to Delhi vary in terms of seating and screens - one of them more comfortable than the other. Food and IFE is still great. Cabin crew lacked smiles and warmth from Delhi to Dubai and the other way, they could not do enough - each of them full flights!

I have been flying with Emirates since past five years but this is happened first time with me. I have already booked online my seat no 22K however while taking boarding pass they changed my seat to 24K. Free breakfast also not provided to me and they did not even have courtesy to ask for meal. While all other passenger got their meal and I feel that I am discriminated from others.

1002,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Dubai to Toronto with Emirates. Staff very nice and accommodating. Seats are OK, no more. They do not offer leg support, you can stretch to have your feet on foot rest but no leg support. They offer thin mattresses which is a good thing because the seats are quite hard. Seat belts are a bit short and offer very limited extension capabilities. Entertainment system is awesome and so is the ""OnAir"" Internet. Good meals. It would be nice if coffee and tea could be offered at the same time they bring the meals. Not sure that the space reserved for the bar/entertainment area is really the best use of that space. Maybe adding washrooms instead would be better.",3,13th October 2017,Canada
1003,"✅ Verified Review | The one area that consistently disappoints with Emirates is their service. I have consistently experienced poor service flying Business class with them. I've often found their economy class staff service to be much better surprisingly. I just cannot understand how an airlines that is so highly rated cannot get their service right especially in Business class. Approached the Business Class check-in person in Dubai with my wife and child and we were greeted by a grumpy lady gesturing to place our passports on the desk. No smiles, no conversation nothing, did her work, handed out our boarding passes and motioned us to the direction of the gate. Not a word was spoken. I was expecting to board directly from one of the gates at the business class lounge as generally is the case with A380 flights but we were motioned to go down to the gate and board from the gate with everyone. At the gate there was no separate boarding for business / first class, waited in the long line with everyone. Once we got into the flight, we settled down onto the amazing business class seats and was looking forward to a comfortable flight. Just then a flight attendant bumped into another attendant who was serving champagne to a customer and the whole contents of the tray spilled over on to me. I was soaked in champagne before the 14 hour journey to Toronto had even started. A quick word of apology was muttered and I was handed a towel to clean up and was directed to the washroom where some more towels were handed out while my seat was being cleaned. I returned back to my seat to find that champagne was still pouring out of the creases and cracks of my seat. I asked for one more towel and never got it. Later during the flight I asked for a headphone for my child and the response I got was ""One was placed on every seat"". That's it. I had to get one myself from another unoccupied seat. Every time the same lady came to clear my table / seat of any clutter or finished meal, I was motioned to place them on her tray. It was like she couldn't be bothered to reach out and pick them up. So I spent the flight collecting things around my seat to place it on her tray every time she came. The whole experience was really shocking especially after the fortune you had coughed up for the experience. Emirates boasts of taking extra effort to take care of children, my 3 year old's presence was not once acknowledged, the only gesture was a child's goodie bag being handed out. We also experienced similarly disappointing service at the Emirates check-in counter at Toronto airport on our way back to Dubai. No smile, no word. I asked if the flight was full to which I got the reply ""Wait I am trying to read something here"". Never ended up getting an answer. The service on the flight (Economy class this time) was however excellent. I commended them on their efforts. Makes me wonder though why the such a difference in service between the two classes? If at all one should experience better service for business class yea? I have encountered similar experiences in previous flights with them as well - generally rude and snobbish flight attendants in business class while the opposite is true for economy class.",2,11th October 2017,United Arab Emirates
1004,✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Cape Town via Dubai. My wife and I were unable to select a seat on our flight from MEL-DXB-CPT until about 48 hour before the flight unless we pay $30 for each sector. We decided against and selected seats 48 hours before the flight. The real problem arose on our return journey from HDS-JNB-DXB-MEL. The HDS-JNB flight was with South African Airline and yet I was unable to checkin the Emirate flight from JNB-DXB-MEL. Emirates website directed us to check in via South African Airlines although the bookings confirmation numbers are different. I did online check in with South African Airline website but they insisted that I can only checkin the Emirate flights with Emirates website. Anyway we arrived in Johannesburg JNB and went to the Emirates check in desk. I explain to the check in person that we require an aisle and the next seat so that we do not have to disturb the next passenger for toilet break. After all explanation she gave us a window and middle seat. She disregarded our request. To top it up she directed our bags to MEL but will not and could give us the boarding pass from DXB to MEL. She stated that there is a regulation and restriction to do so. Surprisingly two other Australians who were checking in in the next counter were giving boarding passes with seat allocation all the way to Melbourne. When we landed in Dubai I went to Emirates service and requested boarding passes and the appropriate seats. To our surprise we were given two seats (under the same booking number). Mine was in row 66 and my wife in row 88. We were totally separated. We were told that the flight was over booked. No amount request and pleading was considered. We were told to go the the boarding gate and ask for different seats but there is no guarantee that we will be together. The Emirates staff were rude and acted like robots. Finally at the boarding gate we were given a window and middle seats. We had to constantly disturb the person sitting in aisle seat for toilet visits. The whole experience with Emirates ground staff was a shocking experience.,2,10th October 2017,Australia
1005,"✅ Verified Review | Melbourne to Auckland. What an amazing experience, words cannot describe how great the service was onboard. From Check In, passport control and customs, everything was fast and efficient. Before departure, I decided to the visit the Qantas First Class Lounge instead of the Emirates Lounge. The plane was delayed up to an hour because of a late arrival of the aircraft from Dubai alongside with the most disorganised boarding process, other than those mishaps everything else was fantastic. Once on board I was greeted by a very lovely and attentive Flight attendant, who walked me to my First Class Suite 2A. Drinks, Arabic coffee and dates were offered right after. As I was the only First Class passenger, the attention I received was beyond what was needed which I deeply appreciated. Breakfast was served right after takeoff, everything tasted delicious and there was endless snacks and drinks on offer even when you don't even ask for it. The onboard service was just on another level, but my greatest appreciation goes to the FA who attended to me, they were just so genuinely nice. Lastly, the IFE is fantastic and always updated with new content. I simply cannot wait for my next flight with Emirates.",9,9th October 2017,Australia
1006,"✅ Verified Review |  Newcastle to Melbourne via Dubai. Decided to pay up for business given our long flights from the UK to Melbourne. I used to fly business in BA for work but last time was over 5 years ago and this service from Emirates was in a different league. The package included car pick ups and overnight at the Dubai hotel was all excellent. The service and room aboard the A380 was the highlight with the entire top floor complete with bar/lounge and I managed to sleep and arrived and returned almost without jet lag. The seat comfort, food and service was outstanding, all flights on time and very impressive all round. In addition the Lounges were all good and we were able to shower and freshen up in Dubai - the Melbourne lounge was particularly impressive. Minor criticisms, I didn't find the film selection great and the 777 seats were not quite as good. All in all, despite the costs excellent value and service.",4,8th October 2017,United Kingdom
1007,✅ Verified Review |  Flew to Mumbai and back via Dubai on Emirates and all flights were comfortable. There was a delay on the last leg back to Heathrow due to a technical issue and whilst the communication could have been better we were given a food voucher which was very much appreciated. The issue was rectified reasonably quickly and the captain made up time en route so we arrived late but not excessively so. Cabin crew were efficient although varied depending on the sector flown. Generally they were cheerful and friendly. Food was fine and the IFE has a huge amount of choice. Despite the delay on the last leg it was still a pleasure flying with Emirates.,7,7th October 2017,United Kingdom
1008,✅ Verified Review |  Booked to fly London to Ahmedabad via Dubai in November 2017. Do not fly with Emirates if you are booking wheelchair assistance. Their support is useless. There is no dedicated support team and their customer staff know nothing.  I have had to pay to reserve seats near the entrance and near the toilets - I have been rated as having higher rate mobility needs as I cannot walk 20m. It has taken 2 hours and 4 staff to get this far. Even Easyjet and Ryanair offer better support. I will never travel Emirates again.,1,6th October 2017,United Kingdom
1009,"✅ Verified Review |  Istanbul to Dubai. Check In, boarding all swift. Very comfortable cabin with good leg room, mood lighting, huge HD screens and Emirates entertainment system with a great deal of new movies. I had booked a diet meal which was excellent with fish and steamed vegetables. Crew extremely attentive and brought everything very quickly. Full service aperitif, I had ordered brandy with Ice, then choice of teas and coffees after dinner served nicely. Very elegant. I had a great time. And we arrived 30 minutes ahead of schedule!",8,5th October 2017,United Arab Emirates

1011,"✅ Verified Review |  Budapest to Jakarta via Dubai was pleasant. The ground staff were courteous, flight was on time on both legs. During the flight the crew were polite and some were quite enthusiastic. The food was good enough. The IFE screen was responsive and a decent selection of entertainment. There were some downsides though - I  think they could update the IFE with more newest movies. I have to admit some of the flight attendants were looking really tired, and even though the food was good enough, i really think they could do a lot better.",7,3rd October 2017,Indonesia
1012,"✅ Verified Review | Check in pretty slick, but after that - oh dear. First flight left late meaning a missed connection. Other aspects of the flight fine - great choice of movies and food was pretty good too. Very little information and infrequent updates but it happens. However I guess it's then how you deal with it that counts. Connections counter horribly busy in Dubai, staff stressed and barely friendly. No flight available for 36 hours, and that is with an extra connection and using a budget airline we always avoid for the second leg (Jetstar). Four hours after landing in Dubai we got to check in at the airport hotel - and only smoking rooms were available. So we had a further miserable wait - including an attempt to chat to the disinterested Emirates customer service representative - before finally getting to our room. Which had 2 beds, 2 pillows, 1 towel and no baby cot as promised. I've had missed connections with the children on both BA and Singapore and while it's never fun, they've been reasonable (BA) or good (Singapore) at dealing with it. Emirates were a sorry shambles and have a lot to learn about dealing with problems. Most miserable flight experience on my first flight with them.",2,2nd October 2017,Australia

Having travelled extensively on different airlines to Europe, USA, Far East, I think I'm adequately qualified to to complain about the lack of courtesy meted out by Emirates staff. They appeared to be a disgruntled lot who found it difficult to even crack a smile. A male attendant was particularly impatient with passengers asking for any service. Even though my husband is a platinum skywards member, I don't think I will be booking on this airline anytime soon. Every passenger, economy to first class deserves the same respect.",8,2nd October 2017,South Africa

The seats were way too crammed with little or no room to turn once reclined - so many business class seats on this flight that service suffered (eg. an hour between courses). Emirates lounges were in fact busier than outside the lounge, just craziness - we waited on the tarmac in Bangkok in a storm for over an hour without any feedback.

I modified my return ticket from 8th September to 10th September through the Emirates application and I have the confirmation and the deduction money message from the bank. The thing is it’s canceled because an error in the system as they told me. They didn’t notify me, call me or send me an email.  I tried to check in online but I couldn’t find the ticket and when I call them they said it’s canceled and you should call us. Then I asked him the flight is about 7 hours no time what to do? He told me to pay 1500DH if I want to come by that flight. I told him it’s your mistake, they said you are right but we can’t do anything for you. So I booked another ticket from another airline cost me 2000Dh. I went to Emirates HQ to complain but they said you should contact our office when you got cancel notification. I said I didn’t got anything. So I lost my return ticket and I lost 2000DH.

1018,"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates is a pretty good airline if you can miss transiting through Dubai airport, which makes your trip a horrendous experience. It is exactly what I did. I chose Emirates for a flight from Brisbane to Singapore. On the positive side, crew were polite and friendly, on board entertainment was good, and I liked the food they served. On the negative side, my seat on the return flight my seat was broken. I think an airline is expected to check their seats function before long haul flights. Besides, the handling of luggage was poor. I checked in a new suitcase, but at my destination, I received a very dirty one filled with oil stains.",8,25th September 2017,Australia
1019,"✅ Verified Review |  Dublin to Denpasar via Dubai. I was expecting something exceptional. The flight from Dublin to Dubai was very average. I was not impressed by the seat comfort but I had 4 seats to myself so this was very pleasant. The entertainment was average with lots of old films which I enjoyed but these could have been better structured and novel. I thought the cabin decor did not look modern. Staff were attentive and pleasant. The flight to Denpasar was crowded in a 777 which had seen better days. No seats free and staff taxed to look after us. No structure of meals was announced so was waiting for food which never came. Video screens were small and I was the lucky one who had the entertainment box at their feet - very uncomfortable. In conclusion, Emirates disappointed. As somebody said, Dubai has got out of control as a hub and standards have slipped. If Emirates want to stay on top, they need to work harder and realise if one takes the eye off the ball, standards slip fast. Just about to enjoy 14 more hours of Emirates.",1,18th September 2017,Ireland
1020,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Mauritius return via Dubai. Outbound flight to Dubai was good. Shame the aircraft was on a remote stand on arrival in Dubai but transit to airport was ok. Flight to Mauritius was satisfactory though at times chaotic with cabin crew not very attentive at times, though understandable given full flight. Return flights were much better.  Made use of the Business Class Lounge whilst on a 10 hour transit in Dubai which was excellent with great facilities - had to pay GBP 80 for the privilege but it was worth it. Wifi was ok, but very unpredictable at times dependent on how many passengers accessed it. Good to see more allowance available for no charge. No complaints. Emirates are my first choice. Good airline Meals were ok, and service was good. ",10,18th September 2017,United Kingdom
1021,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Bangkok via Dubai. I hadn't used Emirates for 3 years, and was surprised at seeing many cuts. Business class ticket was admittedly quite cheap versus other airlines, but even at lower price I felt value for money was poor. Seat comfort is not good and doesn't match many others I have flown in 2016/2017. Food okay, but nothing to mark this out as a premium cabin. IFE is good, although in reality it is not much different to the likes of Singapore, Qatar etc, just that they have loads of different languages and many very old films. Dubai Airport is now horrific, I guess reflecting how downmarket Dubai has become, and lounge was no better than sitting at a coffee shop in the main terminal. This was a 1-way ticket, and quite pleased I opted for a very different return route / airline.",9,13th September 2017,United Kingdom
1022,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Rome. The A380 has more leg room, more arm room and greater lean back. The onboard entertainment had a fantastic selection of movies, tv shows, and games for all ages. The food was okay, the soft drink was free. There were plenty of toilets on board. They were let down by the Dubai airport terminal 3 which is exclusively Emirates and is sadly under equipped (lack of toilets and seating). ",8,7th September 2017,Australia
1023,"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates customer service has certainly dropped their game since I last flew with them a few years ago. An overnight flight from Barcelona to Dubai - simple enough request for a toothbrush kit at end of flight to be advised they no longer do this. This is despite being given a kit only 2 weeks prior on a flight from Sydney to Dubai (to which they answered they do as its 'long haul'). Also, the beef option for the dinner meal had far too much salt in it, could not eat it. If you're not an Emirates frequent flyer it seems they do little to try to get you to become one.

Upon requested to change the meal to the one I selected at the time of booking (veggie), the answer provided was that I did not select the meal. Fact is that I did select the meal as soon as I booked my ticket. In fact, later I called up the airline because I was unable to select Infant meal for all the flights and confirmed that my meal is selected.  I spoke to the air-host and he replied with a question if I selected the meal. He said he'll check the file and get back. He did not. When questioned, he said he does not have any vegetarian meal. I asked for a fruit. That was my meal for lunch. For breakfast, the air-host asked ""What would you like to have (was given 2 choices)"". I said  the one I selected. He replied that he does not have. I thought they don't have the kind of breakfast I was seeking. I walked up to another hostess without the knowledge of this person and she gave me the veggie breakfast.  I was terribly upset, tired with baby on my lap the whole time and hungry. I confronted with him on the flight questioning his conscience of how indifferent he could be. I asked who I should contact for this. His reply was that Emirates does not handle the food and it is a 3rd party company.",2,1st September 2017,United States

In Dubai I was told that I would have to pay excess baggage fees for 2kg of weight in my bag, which came out to US$58. I had plenty of room in my checked baggage and would have been willing to move some items over, but was not given this option in the first airport on my trip where I checked my baggage in.

1029,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to London via Dubai for the 2nd time in the last 18 months. I feel that on several levels, the Emirates product has declined in quality. Being 2m tall, I normally never have issues with being allocated an exit row seat so that I can sit without my legs being restricted by the seat in front of me. 2 weeks prior to flying I had called the Emirates Call Center and spoke to a very helpful gentleman who informed me that exit seats are only allocated on arrival at the airport. Fair enough, I got to BKK early and was allocated an exit Row seat on the flight to Dubai. I was told that I would then need to be allocated an exit Row seat in Dubai. Upon arrival at Dubai which was 3 hours before the flight departed, I was told that all seats had been allocated. Nothing could be done. Thats it. Surely saving exit row seats for people who actually require them is a better way of operating? Other issues. Toilets were filthy, and were not cleaned during the flight. The cabin crew were rarely seen, and seemed quiet content to serve a passenger excess alcohol who was later abusive to passengers. Again, cabin crew were not concerned to sort or prevent this issue. If you want to treated like a herd of cattle, then Emirates are a good option. If you are looking for some basic comforts then there are many better options.",6,18th August 2017,Thailand
1030,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Hong Kong. As a regular in business class on Emirates A380 on this route for 7 years, I was not prepared for what awaited me at the bag drop on Sunday. The supervisor approached me and very pleasantly asked if I would consider being downgraded to economy as the flight was overbooked in all classes. Ready to stand my ground, she made it clear that would be fully understandable. Then she explained that in return for downgrading, the airline would offer the usual business facilities - priority security pass and use of the lounge - plus an unrestricted free round trip business class ticket on the same route valid for a year. Or she could offer me a business class seat on a Thai Airways flight leaving around the same time. Having read horror stories of downgrading and long delays in getting refunds from other airlines, this transaction was conducted without any pressure and with my full understanding that the decision was mine. I took the downgrade and proceeded to the lounge for an excellent lunch. At the gate, the same supervisor took me out of the queue, handed me the voucher for the free return ticket and invited me to board first. This was exemplary service of the highest order. The flight itself was equally fine. I had a comfortable window seat in the first row of the lower deck. Service was efficient and with a smile. I did not take the full meal but the starter and dessert were very tasty. With only one runway functioning at BKK, the flight departed 15 minutes late but arrived on time.",6,17th August 2017,Thailand

Food was good and we liked having proper cutlery and not plastic. We lost an iPad on the first leg of the journey and Emirates not only answere pd our emails promptly, they actually found the iPad and flew it on to an airport of our choice, which was Melbourne. The staff in the Emirates office at Melbourne were also extremely helpful and friendly. Our flight from Colombo was delayed through no fault of Emirates but they offered reassurance and assistance and we made our connection easily with just 10 minutes to go before the gate closed. I fly twice a year to Melbourne and have flown with Air China, Royal Brunei, Quantas, and mainly Etihad and to be honest we have had no problems with any of them, but Emirates have certainly come out the best on this journey.

I requested to meet any supervisor or manager from Emirates, but they said no body available and it is your mistake, you have to check that wheelchair service include in case Emirates missed it. I called customer service (supervisor) for 45 min to complain and at the end he said ""please send your complaint via email, nothing we can do for you right now"".

Their seats and entertainment are good and comfortable. But we are not impressed by the service of the staff. When I asked for hot tea, the staff would say ""you can ask my colleague later"", which you have to wait till you see a staff passing by. The next staff would say the same thing to me too. We had problem checking in the return flight. But there was an error saying that check in is not possible for this flight. We immediately called Emirates but the staff said online check in is not allowed at Heathrow airport, and said we have to check in when we reach the airport the next day.  When we reached the airport, we were told that our return flight was canceled. We were not informed in advance. The staff ushered us to join a long queue which we stood queueing for almost two hours! When we asked what happen, can we get another flight back to Singapore? The staff said ""You will get to choose an earlier or later flight, or put up at a hotel. please talk to the next staff"". The staff didn't even apologise. When we reached the counter, staff asked for our passport, focused on the computer and passed us our boarding pass for tomorrow noon. We didn't even get to choose! So we asked if there is any other option as the one she gave us need to stay another night in the hotel and the transit at Dubai airport is 10 hours. Our flight in London was delayed 14 hours and to make matters worse, the transit in dubai is 10 hours. And we were separated. We asked to get an earlier flight, but again the staff said ""please talk to our staff when you reach Dubai"". She also asked us to reach the airport 4 hours before boarding tomorrow. We tried to enjoy our flight to Dubai and when we reached, we asked the staff to help us get an earlier to singapore. The price I bought for the ticket is for only 1-2 hours transit. 10 hours is too much. The staff said all the flights were full, she could put us at a hotel in Dubai. We rejected, not wanting to stay another day in the hotel. The staff was then willing to help us and she managed to put us on an earlier flight and we were very thankful. The flight back to Singapore was much better, the staff  greeted us amicably. Totally different from the previous crew. ",10,11th August 2017,Singapore
1037,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Newcastle to Trivandrum via Dubai. Emirates is one of the few remaining airlines that offers a differential in Economy class. I love other airlines in Premium, Business or First but so few airlines now stand out with their Economy product. Emirates offers a fabulous economy product, the seat is comfortable, there is sufficient leg room for me at 6 foot 2. The food is good, I like being provided with a menu prior to service, a nice touch. Entertainment is the best in the sky in my experience. A free 20mb of internet browsing is extremely handy if you need to connect and do not want to spend lots of money as is the case with the relatively few airlines that offer any internet service at all. If you want more internet the prices are reasonable. Emirates crews are always in my experience excellent. My only (personal) regret about Emirates is they do not have a competitive price to fly between the UK and Brazil. Its a very long way of getting to Brazil from UK (I do this route frequently). They have such good deals to Africa and Asia I wish they would do the same for South America so I could fly with them more often!",9,7th August 2017,Brazil
1038,"✅ Verified Review | The basics are good and we had a good experience with Emirates from Bangkok to Düsseldorf via Dubai. Especially the newest A380's are very comfortable because the better seats and bigger IFE screens. On our outbound journy we had upper deck seats which are very nice and I do recommend to try to get a seat up there. The older A380's were a bit less comfortable and nice. The difference between the new and old(er) cabin is big, that's a shame. Food is good, sometimes we had to ask for a drink because the cabin crew wasn't walking around that frequently. The food, seat comfort and IFE was good. We experienced some things that annoyed us a little bit. The most important is the delays due to chaotic boarding processes. There was not enough dicipline to succeed the zone boarding system. Plus, the bad communication between staff and customers. Customer service told us it was no problem to link our luggage to Dubai only, and not to Düsseldorf as we planned a long layover to see Dubai. At Bangkok, the check-in agent told us if we wanted to have our luggage checked to Dubai, we had to pay an additional fee of 6800 baht each. Overall: I would recommend flying with Emirates because the comfort.

Normally airlines allow one piece of checked in luggage and one carry on when you fly intercontinental, and then they charge you per extra piece of luggage. But no Emirates allow only 30 kg checked in and 8 kg (1 piece only) carry on, everything extra is charged 100 USD per kg. Since I also had my backpack, I would only carry on that, and had to check in my two suitcases and one carry on.

The best in class is ICE Emirates onboard entertainment services. The movie collection is massive and up-to-date, the music collection is diverse, and the only space left wanting for more are onboard video games.  The display quality is decent.

1051,"✅ Verified Review | Sydney to Christchurch. The flight started off with a visit to the lounge, on time departure and I love that Emirates use such a great product for an International flight over the Tasman. The crew were all greeting with great enthusiasm and smiles when I entered the cabin and followed by an offering of champagne. Business Class was not full, which felt very exclusive and private. Breakfast was served after take off, and was very delicious. I love the ICE entertainment as there is so much available from movies, TV shows to games, and it's great to see that other passengers agree as Emirates won awards for it. To top it off, the crew showed great hospitality and was always willing to help.",9,17th July 2017,Australia
1052,"✅ Verified Review |  Booked to travel Dubai to Johor Bahru via Kuala Lumpur in August 2017. The travel agency booked me a ticket with Emirates and Malaysia Airlines. After that Malaysia Airlines changed the flight from KUL to JHB to be at the evening which means I have to wait 8 hours transit for a distance that takes just 3 hours by car, at the same time I'm going to miss my bookings there. That was a very bad experience when the travel agency tried to change the flight timings to an earlier one so that I could reach there early and take the evening connecting flight on previous day - that was rejected by Emirates as the fare I booked isn't available anymore despite there are many places in Economy class in both flights. The ticketing was done thru Emirates for all flights.",2,17th July 2017,United Arab Emirates
1053,"✅ Verified Review |  Ahmedabad to Los Angeles return via Dubai. An additional amount was paid after few days for pre selection of seats. The seat selection was changed thereafter. A web checkin for my return journey from Los Angeles was done on 12th June. After initial food selection of Vegetarian Hindu meal while purchasing the tickets, on all 3 subsequent occasions, the seat preselection, change in seat and web check in, the meal selection of Vegetarian Hindu meal was repeatedly confirmed. After boarding the flight, the food offered to me was either Chicken/Lamb. On specifically asking for pre selected vegetarian meal, I was told by the staff that my name was not on the vegetarian list at all and was asked to wait till meal was serving was over. I was never approached again for food: vegetarian, fruits, bread or even cookies. The only food I was offered was a small Pizza & then a breakfast which was eggs/ham.",4,17th July 2017,India
1054,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Larnaca via Dubai. I recently upgraded the first leg (JNB-LCA) of my flight en-route to Cyprus. The upgrade was from Business to First Class on the A380.  I was welcomed by friendly crew members. My cabin crew attendant for my flight was excellent and he provided a meticulous service. The crew member provided me with suggestions of wine to accompany all my meals, and a tour of the upper deck. He arranged a flight deck visit upon arrival in Dubai once we parked. The food was excellent, shower is incredible and allows for a refreshing welcome into Dubai. The inflight entertainment is excellent, and the TV in first is massive. I would recommend anyone to upgrade to and/or purchase a first class ticket. It is well worth the money and experience.",10,16th July 2017,Cyprus
1055,"✅ Verified Review |  We flew from Dubai at 2.45am to Sydney and were served breakfast about 4.30am. This was a decent meal, but we were not offered anything more until 9 hrs later when the next meal was supplied, not even water. After 7 hrs I went back to the curtained area and requested some water. There were about four flight attendants chatting and laughing behind the curtains. When we flew Singapore Airlines, they could not do enough for you. Were were constantly asked if we needed water and they supplied fruit, snacks and ice creams. Very disappointed in Emirates.",5,16th July 2017,Australia
1056,"✅ Verified Review |  Good bye Emirates. In January I booked flights with Emirates for my wife and me, Bangkok to Rome via Dubai, returning Munich to Bangkok via Dubai. Due to endless amendments by Emirates our trip turned out to be the worst ever. One month before departure I was informed that flight time from Bangkok to Dubai has been changed. Usually not a big deal, but I would appreciate to be asked instead of putting us on a different flight. On the flight Munich – Dubai one of the flight attendant refused to offer soft drinks except orange juice and water, referring that drinks like Fanta or Coke have to be purchased at the bar. (what bar? as we were flying economy). Waiting for flight Dubai to Bangkok at the boarding area, about 15 minutes before boarding we were informed that it was changed to a different gate and new ETD will be 13:45. Right afterwards their ground staff left without further comment. We found the new gate deserted, leaving passengers for more than 2 hours alone with questions regarding connecting fights, meals or drinks. After having breakfast on the Munich to Dubai flight at around 4am, I expected at least a snack and a drink to bridge the waiting time of 2½ hours. About 20 minutes before boarding the ground staff appeared and informed that the departure will be delayed by another 10 minutes. 10 minutes later we were informed that boarding will delayed by another 10 minutes. At this stage a considerable number of passengers lost their patience and protested loudly. Finally boarding stated at 14:05 instead of 11:45, arriving at Bangkok at 23:45 instead of 21:25. Leaving us for uninformed, hungry and thirsty stranded at Dubai airport for more than 2 hours is unacceptable and contradicting with Emirates claim to be the Best Airline in the World. Under European legislation we would be eligible to a significant refund, but unfortunately we needed to book our flights in Bangkok. With the recent reduction of economy luggage allowance from 30 to 20 kgs (unless you are willing to pay extra $ for a “saver” ticket) and the implementation of a reservation fee of 25USD per person, Emirates is getting closer to traditional low cost carriers, while asking for premium rates. As a result of their new policy and the unacceptable mistreatment during our recent trip, we will avoid flying Emirates in the future.",9,13th July 2017,Thailand
1057,✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Melbourne. The flight didn't start well as the departure was delayed for over an hour an no announcements were made. Once boarded we found the cabin configuration rather cramped. Lie flat beds were satisfactory but fairly hard and narrow. There is no convenient place to store small items while sleeping. Overhead lockers were good. The mainly female flight attendants were distant and in some cases unfriendly. Service was poor. Cabin supervisor was good but he couldn't be everywhere. Overall it was a very disappointing flight.,9,10th July 2017,Australia
1058,✅ Verified Review |  London to Melbourne via Dubai. I am a skywards gold member for over a decade. The quality of service is a bit hit and miss. I have noted that they don't strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy and business over more loyal passengers. I will be considering taking my business elsewhere as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore. To add insult to injury it is now impossible to use miles to upgrade on flights out of London now!,4,6th July 2017,United Kingdom
1059,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Manchester via Dubai. When booking tickets I was asked if we'd like to pre book the seats a the cost was £20 per seat per flight, as it was a leg flight both ways this cost us £80 each. Outbound was great however before returning I was asked to contact Emirates which I did. I was told flight times and aircraft had been changed, and asked if we'd like to pre book seats - cost would be £40 each. I explained we had already done this and was put on hold, then told we couldn't have our pre booked, paid-for seats and given different seats. I complained at check in and was told I should have read the small print as I'd done it over the phone there was no mention that Emirates could change them if they wanted and that we were only actually paying to have either a window or aisle seats. We will definitely be flying with alternative airlines in future.",7,5th July 2017,United Kingdom
1060,"✅ Verified Review |  Munich to Durban via Dubai. My trip to my son's wedding started with the chauffeur driver arriving late, apparently because of having been given the incorrect collection time. The flight from Durban to Dubai was comfortable and the FAs worked flat out to deal with a full flight. It was very useful to receive information on the gates for our connecting flights, before we landed. The comfortable facilities of Terminal A at Dubai made for a very pleasant wait. The boarding and flight to Munich on the A380 was seamless, with the bonus of the best chauffeur drive experience and facilities to my son's home, that I have had. The return trip from Germany to Durban was equally enjoyable and pleasant. Unfortunately, I need to mention two negative factors - the one being the ongoing poor selection of food at King Shaka International and the other being the chauffeur drive from KSIA, which I would prefer to elaborate on in a more private manner.",1,5th July 2017,South Africa
1061,✅ Verified Review |  Brisbane to Dubai. I am a skywards gold member and has used this airline for few years. The quality of late has been inconsistent with some sectors offering fantastic service but some offering poor service. I have noted that they don't strictly stick to skyward status while upgrading and some passengers with lower tier status get upgraded if flying in economy over more loyal passengers. I will be taking my business to another airline as they don't reward loyalty and service is not that great anymore.,10,5th July 2017,Australia
1062,"✅ Verified Review |  Bahrain to Nairobi via Dubai. The Emirates policy of applying excess baggage charges for items purchased in duty free on the DXB to NBO sector is arbitary. I have flown Emirates on a number of occasions and have never seen a weight scale at a departure gate in DXB. Each economy passenger was directed ""as per airline policy"" to weigh all cabin bags, including those containing duty free items. The response from Emirates ground staff for extra items bought in duty free was either pay the excess or return the items for a refund from the outlet. I understand the weight limits for cabin baggage from a safety perspective. However, I have not seen any objections from an ground staff when a passenger has purchased a number of duty free items in departures. Returning on the NBO to DXB sector no similar policy applied, same for the DXB to BAH leg. Emirates need to treat all passengers as people.  Staff at the gate ignored my request to have the extra cabin bag, (bought in DXB duty free) loaded into the hold, one option used by some airlines. Overall, if you strip away the slick advertising of the brand summed up as ""we are the best, (in our view) what you are left with is an economy service that includes food, IFE and cabin crew. My conclusion is very much ""buyer beware"".",7,4th July 2017,Bahrain
1063,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Taipei. Great plane, shame about the seats which are so uncomfortable. Plenty of space and quiet aircraft.

ICE system is always a bonus.",3,4th July 2017,United Arab Emirates
1064,✅ Verified Review | I was flying from Perth to Colombo with Qantas but the flight from Singapore to Colombo is operated by Emirates. As soon as I got in the flight the crew was very friendly and even helped me with my hand luggage since I had a shoulder injury. Once the flight took of it was very hard to speak anyone in the crew. I even had to wait for more than 20 minutes for staff to answer the call bell. This was not the first time experienced this type of behaviour as my previous flight to Colombo from Perth via Dubai everyone in the crew had a huge attitude.,1,3rd July 2017,Australia

We checked in online and arrived at the airport in plenty of time and check in was no problem. We took off on time, the meals were good and the inflight entertainment was good. We arrived at Dubai and had plenty of time to wander round the airport before our flight to Auckland. The A380 is a great aircraft, meals were good and again entertainment very good and the staff could not have been nicer. We have no complaints about Emirates and we will use them in future.

1069,✅ Verified Review |  Flew Emirates from Bangkok to Dubai. I enjoyed my flight. Check in and boarding was quite easy. The service was very friendly. Perhaps they could have offered some more food after take off when drinks were served given it was a 6 hour flight. All they offered was a small savoury snack. Breakfast however was excellent. The A380 was very comfortable.,4,27th June 2017,Australia
1070,"✅ Verified Review |  I was impressed by my flight from Melbourne to Singapore. Very quick check in. The service was very friendly and efficient.

1071,"✅ Verified Review | Right from ticketing counter to boarding the flight from Bangalore to San Francisco via Dubai on Emirates was the worst. Boarding at BLR airport by Emirates ground staff was an absolute mess. No announcements of gate changes or boarding by seat rows. At Dubai airport, we found out our pre-booked seats were changed and given really bad seats. When complained and talked to the Supervisor at the Emirates customer service was complete disregard to customers. On board the flight, we have pre-ordered special meals was not even acknowledged by the crew. When informed about the pre-ordered the meals, the crew rudely said they have to check their paperwork. Is that a customer issue or fault? Seats are extremely hard and uncomfortable. This is our first and last travel on Emirates.",7,25th June 2017,United States
1072,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to London Heathrow. This A380 was relatively a new aircraft. The business class flat bed seats were new and clean. Onboard ICE entertainment system is fantastic. The meal service was high in terms of standards with a large selection of hot and cold courses. . I do recommend the Emirates A380 experience. However, the ground staff at Dubai airport were quite slow and despite the flight leaving in the off-peak time at DXB, there was still a minimal delay.",6,22nd June 2017,United Kingdom

Got an upgrade to business flying from Birmingham to Dubai but wow did we know we were not a premium flyer. No lounge, no fast track, menu was mediocre and after a 7 hour overnight flight no breakfast. Probably the worst thing though is that feedback can only happen via their forms which they don't answer. The customer service emails don't work. Overall there are more caring airlines at Cathay, Singapore or Qatar Airways. Think twice.",1,21st June 2017,United Kingdom
1074,"✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to Sydney. What an amazing experience. My journey started off with an early check-in, quick and efficient as always and relaxation within the Lounge, well stocked with food and beverages. Upon entering I was greeted and made very welcomed, the cabin crew even walked to my suite, 1A. The features of the flight was explained to me from meal service to the famous shower facilities onboard the A380. The meal service was delicious. Privacy within your suite is great, the doors closes with a touch of a button, double shaded windows and the seat was very wide and comfortable at any position. First Class was on another level and I recommend everyone try it at least once. The cabin crew were very attentive. I will definitely fly Emirates long haul to see how consistent their service are, crew and hard product.",6,21st June 2017,Australia
1075,"✅ Verified Review |  Good journey from Manchester to Dubai. Had a 1hr 25min connection time for our flight to Bangkok. When we got to Dubai the plane seemed to take an age to park up, the pilot said that there was a slight delay as waiting for a slot. We stopped, and were bussed off: why does such a modern airport have to bus people off such a large modern aircraft? Eventually got on to our bus. Bus starts up and takes what seems like forever to get to terminal, people around us even joked that we're going straight into town, it just kept driving & driving. I've never been on a plane to terminal bus that long ever. As we got off, an airport official was asked about Bangkok flight and says 'you better run for it!' So we run for it, two adults and a child. Eventually get to the gate hot and sweaty, no time for water or coffee, & angry that we had to run. No explanation as to why we had to run for our connecting flight. We show our stuff and then try to find our way to the plane. Nobody there to help, point the way etc, we had to ask cleaners where the plane was. Got on the plane for another 6.30hrs flight hot, thirsty and angry. The staff on the plane were really nice and gave us some water. We don't fly very often, but when we do we'll think twice about flying with Emirates again.",3,14th June 2017,United Kingdom
1076,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Hamburg. Great flight The seat spacing was large and cabin furnishings modern and luxurious. The food was high quality.

I think Emirates distinguishes the very good cabin equipment with many  details. ,10,9th June 2017,Germany
1077,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Singapore. Emirates was disappointing compared to Singapore Airline or other major carriers like Qatar Airways. Would not recommend flying with them as they damaged my bag, admitted it, but didn't want to resolve it.  I would recommend that you watch out with this airline of damaging your things severely and then absolutely not caring as there's nothing you can do to protect yourself. Very unresponsive staff across the organization which is not ideal. Everything seems like it's done in a backdoor manner.",10,8th June 2017,Canada
1078,"✅ Verified Review |  Mauritius to London via Dubai. Very disappointed in Emirates - I believed them to be a premium airline however we upgraded twice to business and both times were denied lounge access. The service onboard was also not great. Emailed customer services but no response as yet. Would not bother flying with them again.

Chose the Japanese breakfast and dinner options on flights to/from Narita, and must say that catering out of Narita provides me with the best business class meal I've have had on Emirates since I started using them 4 years ago.

Check in opened two hours before departure, together with fast lane security an invitation to the excellent La Valletta Club lounge was given. This lounge even has an outdoor area where you can view the aircrafts landing and starting. A separate bus was provided to the aircraft where I was welcomed by the international crew. Juice was served before take-off, champagne in the air, then the menues were handed out. A three course menu was served with the possibility to choose between various alternatives. An international variety of wines and other beverages were also available. Landing on time after 2 hrs and 10 minutes. Free complimentary transfer to hotel in Larnaca.

They were kind and attentive, making sure everything from serving food and drinks to attending small needs was met with a smile. Nothing was too much, which makes this the best crew I have flown with. The Business Class was quite empty, but then it was only a three hour flight on such a large aircraft. Food was delicious, cabin clean and a very private and comfortable seat with plenty of storage. I would not hesitate to fly with Emirates again.",8,1st June 2017,Australia
1082,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to Newcastle via Dubai. This is the second return flight with Emirates to South Africa. Emirates may have competitive fares but this is not an award winning airline from my experience. The service on the last flights were poor especially the Johannesburg to Dubai leg, cabin staff nowhere to be seen, no water or juice offered inflight and the snack advertised a sandwich but this was also not offered and had to be asked for. The worst thing was that I had purchased the Flex fare which costs more than the saver but allows advance booking of seats. Emirates changed the aircraft a month before the flight but did not notify and the seat configuration was different meaning I was seated in a location I had not selected. Customer service was not interested and I received a poor response. I will be looking to use another airline in future.",1,29th May 2017,United Kingdom
1083,"✅ Verified Review |  Chennai to Adelaide via Dubai. Emirates let me down. I had a lot of expectations as I frequently fly with Qatar and Etihad and based on what I heard, expected Emirates to be outstanding. Chennai-Dubai flight was outstanding! Refurbished aircraft (A6-ECL), the food was amazing, excellent legroom and crew were top class. But then came Dubai to Adelaide. I ended up flying on a old Boeing 777 (A6-EGW) which had old, unresponsive IFE (not touch screen), the crew were pretty much non-existent the whole flight. I had no legroom for that 12hr flight (I'm 6'2""). The crew did not wake me up to eat (even though I had the wake me up to eat sign up), they didn't give me my Australian immigration card. Sure, you might say they didn't want to wake me up, but they didn't even take the courtesy to put the immigration card in my seat pocket! Because of that, I had to go to Adelaide and get one at the airport security there to fill, when others just went past me. Alas, I was not the only one, they left out another 4-5 people without immigration cards too. The only thing good about Emirates is their infight meals. What I'm most surprised about is, how come a short haul flight is excellent and long haul flight a disaster? Emirates really need to get their heads together. ",10,27th May 2017,Australia
1084,"✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to Boston via Dubai. Dubai-Boston was good. Flight with a lot of turbulence. Flight crew were kind, well mannered and happy to chat. Inflight entertainment system with an awesome collection of movies, tv shows, music etc. The aircraft is pretty old by now and you can feel it thanks to narrow passageway, narrow seats as compared to other airlines & small lavatories. Legroom is at a premium in Economy class. Food was ordinary as my travel agent selected Hindu meal as meal preference.

From the moment you arrive at the check in you have the most luxurious airport lounge featuring an extensive range range of fine food, drinks and services.  As you board the uppper deck business class cabin your greeted with the feeling you have just walked on board a luxury yacht. From the wood finishes to the quality seating, entertainment and food you do feel as though it's the flight and not the destination that you are more interested in. And they dim the lights and to show ceiling stars.  I would be amiss if I left out the professional staff that serve you.

Business Lounge in both Paris and Dubai is beyond expectation especially in Dubai boarding and check in gate is located inside the business class lounge itself very convenient.

The first leg from Taipei to Dubai was comfortable without any complication, and despite of the late time, the crew was friendly and talkative. Inflight entertainment is still one of the best I have experienced and now there is even a little tiny amount of free WiFi (up to 10Mb) to use, but you can buy a 500Mb plan for 1 USD. Provided meals and the selection of drinks were marvelous. A small sanitary kit with socks, eye cover, earplugs, toothbrush and toothpaste was handed out.

A fantastic plane and superior to the 777 product, the seats are a lot more comfotable, you can actually put your feet under the chairs in front to stretch out. In flight entertainment is outstanding, the flight attendants worked hard, plenty of drinks brought around. On outbound flight we were served a full meal at around 11pm, 2 hours after take off and then a light bun and tea prior to landing, it would have been more practical to serve a more substantial breakfast. I found the quality of food good, my only dissappointment with them is the charge they have implemented to choose seats, and if you're a family you may feel compelled to pay so you can sit together. However 48 hours prior to check in it is free, and I found plenty of seating available.

From Kuala Lumpur to Dubai, the inflight service and food were excellent, not to mention sitting on the A380 Business Class seat was really comfortable with lots of privacy. However, the onward flight from Dubai to Milan Malpensa was not on par to the previous one. Service was ad hoc and food wasn't good plus the Boeing 777-300ER Business Class seats with configuration of 2-3-2 wasn't comfortable at all, even with mattress provided.

Third time I asked Senior flight attendant, he gave me little bottle. Finally air started to chill a little 3 minutes before departure. Total delay 1 hour 50 minutes. Why we were board to bus and brought to the plane if it was not ready and no staff provided clear comments what was going on.

On a last return trip flights itself were faultless - well almost - my original seat was slightly out of the shape and I had to change seats once. However my complementary Dubai Connect overnight stay was a mess - after landing in Dubai a little over 1pm I finally got into hotel room just before 6pm. I spent all time waiting in queues. Also nobody at hotel knew how and what time I'm going to be picked up in the next morning. Next morning the Hotel staff advised me to take a taxi to the airport and that the bill will be refunded by Emirates. They were wrong - Emirates customer service basically accused me of being cheat after I requested refund for the taxi. I took a taxi but apparently I had to wait for some mysterious bus Hotel staff didn't know about - I would never request the refund in the first place if I new it will turn out this way.

Flight attendants extremely arrogant, lazy and chatting. Food was nice and original, great wines and Champagne.",9,28th April 2017,Brazil
1096,"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Bangalore via Dubai. Until now I have always enjoyed flying Emirates. Real quality however proves itself when things go wrong. And then Emirates customer service is very low quality. On our flight to Bangalore we got delayed by more than 10 hours. First airplane was hit by lightning and had to be checked, replacement took long and when a new plane was ready and we had boarded it turned out that Bangalore airport was closed during the day due to construction works (Emirates knew this before), we had to offboard again in Dubai and wait for more than 8 hours. Except for some not too fresh rolls no help or service was provided. Customer service refused any help, for instance helping to find a hotel, a place to sleep or proper compensation. We were sent from one side of Dubai airport to another all the time. An online complaint only gets a marketing answer but no real solutions or compensation was provided. On the way back from Bangalore I had pre-booked a dietary request: Asian vegetarian. It turned out Asian vegetarian was a standard choice on this flight. By the time the trolly reached me all vegetarian meals were gone. As a vegetarian I only could chose chicken. The steward said they forgot about me and again I only could get a not too fresh roll. Again an online complaint, some vague excuses as an answer but no real compensation. So to conclude, in general Emirates is excellent, but when problems arise the services they provide are like a low cost airliner. Disappointing and I do not know if I would recommend them.",9,27th April 2017,Netherlands
1097,"✅ Verified Review |  Amsterdam to Dubai. I already have a complaint before I get into the plane. I had made a typo in his first name when booking an extra ticket for my son. There was Sterfan instead of Stefan (so letter r too much). I called Emirates to ask if this was a problem. This had to be changed, because at the airport this would cause problems and could not be changed. Cost was 47 EUR. Really absurd. This feels worse than a traffic fine because you drove 4 km too hard. I understand that this is something in the Terms & amp; Conditions state, but for me a reason not to choose for Emirates anymore.

1098,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Perth via Dubai and back, on the A380 and Boeing B777-300. My first impression is that the airline care for its passengers. The level of service I received in Emirates is equal to the service I got from Etihad Airways. Crew is very attentive to passengers needs, and are very convenient. I asked for little gifts for my children, they gave me four times (on each flight) a complete set of toys and miscellanous for kids. On the Perth section, we were only 127 passengers onboard the A380 and the flight was very pleasant, with a very fascinating InFlight Entertainment system. However, I got disapointed by the attitude of the Cabin Crew manager on one flight, and it made me think about never flying with them anymore. I saw this manager seriously harassing one attendant.",8,24th April 2017,Ukraine

Food was also rather uninteresting, staff 'forgot' to offer any drinks with the meal, very impersonal service. Not that flight was full.",10,24th April 2017,Thailand
1100,"✅ Verified Review |  Dusseldorf to Shanghai return via Dubai. J All in all not an excellent experience with Emirates being the leg from Shanghai to Dubai the worst. Boeing 777 aircraft in 2-3-2 configuration in Business class is clearly not matching the high expectations you have if flying with this airline. The seat on this leg was old style not fully lie flat which made this morning flight quite unpleasant. Also remarkable for me that Emirates provided only on the night flight from Dubai to Shanghai an amenity kit. The content even being from a high rated known cosmetic company is not special at all lacking ear plugs. Seen much better Kits eg. Turkish Airlines or even at Tap Portugal. In general the A380 cabin and seat better but inconsistent. Seats and plugs different on all 3 flights in A380. Seat lie flat but felt unconfortable to me as uneven. Also negatively surprised by the service level provided by the crew which was from hectic to chaotic. As noticed from others fellows in this Forum seems to be a hit or miss. Though always announced from the Cockpit ""as award winning cabin crew"" I was unfortunate and got too often the miss. Only exception was the crew on the B777 leg contrasting to the aircraft. Food always better in the lounges than on board. Highlight for me the Emirates Lounge in Düsseldorf. For me the best food offer and comfort level I had in a lounge. Will recommend Emirates but image is better than reality.",10,23rd April 2017,Germany

I made a seat reservation 2 months in advance and on arrival they took my ticket and handed me a new one with an aisle seat instead of the booked window seat without saying anything. I only noticed once I was looking for my seat. After the flight I claimed my miles for the flight online but when booking my next flight now I saw they were not added and when contacting Emirates they told me there was no way for me to still receive those miles even if I know I claimed them within the given time frame.

Free floating Veuve Clicquot, very well mixed drinks and food choice. The full flat beds were extremely comfortable and the space was more than enough (I couldn't see my neighbor). Also I liked the idea of having your own minibar next to you. But I missed an amenity kit. This was a little bit of a negative point. Also there was a little bit of confusion during check-in. A lot of business passengers did not find their assigned waiting zone. The free Wifi is great albeit quite slow. Massive entertainment program like no other.

Got woken up for food and loved it! Arrived in Dubai, used the lounge as I'm a silver member so got a shower, ate some food and then as I was boarding for the second leg of my journey from Dubai to Newcastle I got upgraded to Business class again! It's just what I needed for my eighth flight in two weeks! Needless to say Business class was incredible, the service was flawless and I had more than everything I needed for the flight.

All good from London to Dubai, but then we were told we were not booked on the flight from Dubai to Brisbane as it was over booked and they needed someone to take another flight. We had booked this flight and our seats 6 months before. So after an hour arguing with them we were permitted to fly but were given alternative seats next to the kitchen. Subsequently we could not sleep because of the noise plus my entertainment system was dead. I complained 3 times and was told they would reboot it but it never happened. So on my return I contacted customer service and was informed my it would take 30 days to look into my complaint. Here we are 52 days later and not another word. All in all very poor and disappointing service from Emirates.",9,20th April 2017,United Kingdom
1106,✅ Verified Review | Bangalore to Budapest via Dubai. My first international travel was with Emirates and it was quite pleasant. Airport transfer was a little bit confusing as the transit time was short which caused a rush in Dubai.

The seat pitch was upto the mark and overall experience was pretty good.,5,19th April 2017,India
1107,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Lisbon, EK191 on 17th April. Was this the same airline as we flew out on? The check in staff were able to book our luggage through to our final destination (Faro) but not us! This created a bit of a problem for the TAP staff at Lisbon. On boarding the cabin crew were chatting among themselves in the galley areas and there was no-one to welcome us to our normal (47K) seat in the rear cabin. There was a noticeable tension and seemed to be a lack of teamship amongst the crew with false smiles rather than the genuine ones of the outbound crew. Continental breakfast was served but the coffee/tea forgotten - our call bell ignored and when my wife went to ask for coffees she was told ""okay but it will be cold"". After this they disappeared into the galley areas for 5 hours, occasionally rushing through the cabin but ignoring our call bell when we fancied a drink before lunch which was then served 1.5 hours before landing meaning that it was rushed - coffee and wine were being offered at the same time and they wanted to clear trays before we had even finished the main course (which to add to our dismay was tough, grisly beef). The whole service seemed to lack leadership which comes from the cabin supervisor - so if anyone from Emirates reads this I would hope they investigate. On the good side the flight was on time, seat comfortable and flight crew informative.",4,19th April 2017,Portugal

This flight was superb from beginning with special assistance at Lisbon, on time, comfortable seats, informative flight crew, very good meal, through to special assistance at Dubai. The cabin crew were one of the the best we have come across, genuinely friendly on an a full flight, welcoming everyone onboard, regularly coming round to check that everything was alright and enquiring if we wanted more drinks and wishing all passengers a friendly farewell. Cost cutting was evident in that the seafood option has been removed as has the pre-landing snack/icecream, but the meal provided (braised beef) was tender and tasty and larger than previous. Price was higher than normal because we had to travel over the Easter period.",1,19th April 2017,Portugal
1109,"✅ Verified Review | Delhi to Amsterdam via Dubai. You know what to expect when you are flying with Emirates. The 777s are inconsistent in their economy class seats - some have USB ports and other have older seats. The food (AVML) is always superior and especially flying out of Dubai - actually the best plane food is served on Emirates. Seat comfort on 777 is sub-par in comparison to the economy seating in A380 which is the most comfortable I have been on in terms of leg space, seat width, recline and fittings. The quietest cabin on the lower deck on the A380 is the one at the back and yes, it does give a premium economy experience being exclusive with fewer seat rows. WiFi on board is inexpensive but can be spotty depending on the routes. IFE, of course, remains, fabulous. Cabin crew are mostly friendly - some are heartwarming and very helpful, while others forget their smile at home. All aircraft were very clean, have great in flight lightning including StarLight on the cabin ceiling (which I love) and well stocked, clean washrooms. The business class lounge in Dubai is sometimes very busy and the Concourse B one has the coveted Moet and Chandon bar which is a must visit if you have status. Showers are great and so is the food and service the lounge. Definitely recommend this airline.",10,16th April 2017,India

When went to board the second flight at DXB, they weighed my carry ons at the gate and asked me to pay $241. This would have made the return 40% more expensive than the full ticket price.

1111,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Cairo via Dubai. Emirates first class is a special travel experience. I could have flown direct to Dubai to transfer for Cairo, but I cut the journey in half by changing planes in Bangkok (saved more than USD2000), although that's 6 sectors of flying in total, but all in first class, and I saved a great deal. 4 sectors were in the spacious A380 with luxurious shower bathroom, the other 2 in B777, all suites. I was served with excellent cuisine, drinks and the service was so attentive without being too intrusive. The bed was one of the most comfortable I've slept on in the sky, and the shower incredible. While I was off to my shower, my bed was made for me, with night snack of fruits and herbal tea all ready. Emirates ICE entertainment system is the best system. The privacy door is a huge bonus especially for sleeping. The vanity mirror, mini on the side etc. Excellent massage function of the seat. USD 1 for 500 MB of wifi data, every detail has been well thought of. Then there is the excellent menu and such extensive wine list! If you got the budget or mileage to upgrade, here's the way to do it to pamper yourself. I took one star off for the inconveniently closed Bangkok lounge due to renovations. A shared lounge (CIP) was used and it was very lack lustre..",5,14th April 2017,Hong Kong

So, I was downgraded twice (at different days and on different flights). I asked the refund of the difference of fares. Emirates denied it and made a refund of only 500€. As I had kept screenshots of my booking, I produced the screenshots to Emirates. Finally, Emirates  refund the actual difference of fares (total of 1 000 € as I asked).

1113,"✅ Verified Review |  Cape Town to London via Dubai. Flew Emirates on family recommendations and to be honest they were okay but not worth the hype. The 777 with the 3-4-3 configuration is uncomfortable and cramped. Asking £20 per leg to select seats is robbery when you are only transiting from one aircraft to another. that would have added £160 to the price of 2 return tickets. The crew were indifferent and did not really communicate with you, they were distant, I asked for a drink with my meal which never arrived and part of my meal tray was missing but by then I had given up. They seemed disorganised at service times. On 4 flights only had one 'comfort' bag with socks, eye mask and toothbrush in.  The A380 was a much nicer aircraft and reasonably comfortable and we did have a spare seat next to us. Food was again okay. Overall pay a bit more and go Qatar Airways.

1118,"✅ Verified Review |  Dublin to Tokyo via Dubai. I secured a real bargain rate for a first class ticket. I did not see any evidence of cost cutting throughout the experience. Standards were high and the crews encountered displayed a high level of motivation. We still have the Boeing 777 as the only option from Dublin but they were all in superb condition. Plenty of complementary goodies for the ladies and as much food and drink you fancied at the click of the galley button. The Dubai stopovers were well organised and a really good room at Le Meridien was provided, along with copious food and beverage vouchers. The Timeless spa concession at the 1st class lounge I found to be a white elephant, unable to get an appointment and they did not mention this is only available at the main concourse B, after the long walk to concourse C. The only downside was not Emirates fault. A long reroute from Tokyo because of the tensions in the area and 11 hrs of heavy turbulance with the crew struggling even with the basics.  All in all couldn't fault them given the culture of cut everything to the bone by some airlines at the moment.",8,27th March 2017,United Kingdom

Coming to Seychelles we had more then one piece of hand luggage, but leaving Seychelles they insisted on Emirates rules of single piece of hand luggage at 7.5 kilos max. The Emirates representative was absolutely helpless.  When I offered to pay extra for 2 kilos of hand luggage she just said there is no such option and she cannot help.

I booked this flight six months ago and was travelling with infant so I had already selected bulkhead seats at the front of both legs of my journey. However, Emirates decided to change my seats two weeks before from 8A to 38D on DXB-ISB route making me furious. Upon calling them I was given the usual answer that the aircraft was changed which was a blatant lie as it was the same aircraft. Emirates need to honour the commitments they make as it was a nightmare with an infant moving right back in the aircraft so all the hypes of portraying itself as a family friendly airline was proved wrong.

This is the second time while travelling business class the crew has informed me that they are running short on the main entree and I could not have the food at s later time as they were warming all the food together.

I wasn’t told it was Emirates policy that they assess every passenger’s hand luggage including items bought at the airport before you board the plane. The 7kg allowance prior to departure in London was more due to my duty-free shopping. I was told by the ground floor supervisor/manager that I have to reduce the weight of my hand luggage or pay $200 for extra weight or return my duty-free shopping but I refused to do so.

1127,"✅ Verified Review |  Starting with the best part: one of the reasons we selected Emirates is that they fly the A380 on all legs of our journey from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Dubai. The whole upper deck of Emirates A380 is Business class. The seats are configured 1-2-1. You can make a 180 degrees bed from it, there's a huge screen, a separate tablet (no idea why) and a mini bar with some drinks on it. Lots of space for everything. In the back there's a bar with lots of delicious small things to eat and a good reason to leave your chair from time to time, even if you do not normally visit bars. The A380 is super silent. We flew Business Class on a Qatar 787 earlier and the noise level of the 787 is so much higher than that of the Airbus. The A380 is the best plane we have flown, unbelievable that they have struggled for orders. Emirates has more: free limousine service up to 65 km, in comfortable cars and all well arranged. Lounges in Dubai and Bangkok offer great food and other facilities like a shower, the Schiphol lounge in contrast has just a few things to eat. But Emirates has drawbacks too. Vegetarian meals in business class are very poor. One of our meals mainly consisted of two salads of the type ""what are the cheapest ingredients we can find"". Why not serve what they serve in their lounges? The best Business Class meals so far were from KLM. No A380's but well thought about vegetarian meals. Also we phoned if they could combine vegetarian and gluten free. That could be arranged but it wasn't. They can't. On a business class ticket with a list price of multiple 1000's euros. And it really is not so difficult. Qatar could do it. Qatar also serves the meal when you want - Emirates serves the meal shortly after you enjoyed the Dubai lounge buffet. Two more drawbacks: when we complained the reply was something like ""Sorry you didn't like it but Emirates serves the best food in the airline industry"". So they can't serve nice vegetarian meals and on top of that they don't take complaints seriously. What I also disliked is that the entertainment system (which in itself is the best we have ever seen, title wise) displays news messages on all selection screens. Why would I want that? I am on holiday and don't want to read news. But it can't be switched off.",10,9th March 2017,Netherlands
1128,"✅ Verified Review |  My recent flight from Taipei to London via Dubai was thoroughly enjoyable, both night and daylight flights. Taipei to Dubai sector was full yet the crew managed to address passengers by name and were attentive. I love the onboard bar and despite full capacity, was rather empty, with most snuggled up to sleep. It was a 4 hour connection to London at Dubai. Even though the Dubai lounge with its facilities for relaxing, sleeping or dining, I had to wait 45 minutes for a shower to be available. However, I was refreshed for my flight back to London, the service was impeccable. Even after a Venison main course and cheese board lunch, the crew were inviting me to the bar for more snacks. I have noticed that the A380s on the Taipei-Dubai, Hong Kong-Dubai and Singapore-Dubai flights are newer seating than the London-Dubai A380s. My one small beef about Emirates Business Class is the seat itself. It must be narrowest - just an inch wider than the Economy I think. I am small, but I find it still too narrow compared to other airline seats which are 20-22 inches wide. One passenger I spoke to said he could not get any sleep and felt claustrophobic. I guess seat width has been sacrificed to include the clutter of the Mini Bar and Tablet (I've never seen anyone use the Tablet). Overall Emirates for me is good value, and cheaper than flying direct to Asian destinations, and I enjoy the break in Dubai anyway.

1131,"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates A380 from Manchester to Dubai was modern and comfortable and staff although friendly and polite were kept very busy by a fullish flight. IFE probably the best in the sky and on a decent sized screen too. From Dubai to Jakarta was a much older plane with smaller screens but attendants just as nice. What let this airline down was the food. First flight they had only chicken left when they got to me so even though I was hungry I declined but imagine my surprise when later I saw the cabin crew tucking into the ""left over beef meals"" including the stewardess who had served me. On the second flight I was served what is probably the worst beef meal I have ever witnessed on a plane so again nothing to eat. My moto now is bring your own sandwiches whether the airline is budget or supposed premium class.

Emirates made trying to get a refund nearly impossible. No customer care and branded me a no show when I was in front of check in and attended by Terminal 3 manager who spoke to the check in clerk. Customer Services staff passed me from one person to another, eventually discovered that my ticket was blocked so couldn't get a refund until that was listed. No response from UK office, just not interested - and indeed if I had rebooked with Emirates I would have been charged an additional £200 but if you are taken ill and spend days in hospital Emirates charges you £213.

1134,"✅ Verified Review |  Los Angeles to Delhi via Dubai. We have flown Emirates several times to visit family in India. However, in December 2016, an issue arose with our plane during take off. Unfortunately, it all went downhill from there. They kept us on the plane at the gate for 3 hours. They fed us dinner and right after we were told to exit the plane. We knew we wouldn't be taking off that night, so having us sit in the gate area would've allowed for more comfort and food options. After those 3 hours, we stood in a line for 3 hours to get a hotel voucher since the next flight we could be on was not until Friday morning (it was 1am Wed Night at this point) and did not live close to the airport. We obtained the hotel voucher and headed to our hotel, only to be returned because the hotel was full and said the airline didn't call them to approve the availability. Needless to say, we didn't get to a hotel until 5am. We were put in a hotel 12 miles away and were told we could get refunded for the Uber, but it's been 2 months since the receipt was submitted and still have not received the $58 back. Flight Friday was delayed again by about 5 hours, so we missed our connection and had to stay in Dubai a night since there were no open flights. So we missed 4 days of our trip. The cabin is nice, clean and updated. The food is usually pretty good for airplane food! There is good pitch between seats and good seat width. On our trip back though, our seat cushions were pretty poor in quality and rather uncomfortable/hard to sit on. I would fly again, but seeing how they recently changed their ""saver"" rates to where you cannot choose your seat until check-in, we are looking for another airline. For such long flights, it would be nice to have peace of mind that your family will be sitting together.",9,1st March 2017,United States
1135,"✅ Verified Review |  Singapore to Melbourne. Before boarding I was paged to see the ground staff which I did and was asked by a rude staff if I could change my exit row seat for another passenger wishing to seat as a couple. I said no. Then during the messy boarding process I was refused boarding and directed to go back to the counter to see another ground staff, I was made to wait and treated as if I had done something wrong. The staff later took my boarding pass with an annoyed look clicked on her computer and handed back to me without a word. No explanation, no apology nothing such rudeness in the way they treat passengers. On boarding the aircraft witness an angry passenger who wanted my seat apparently and made a fuss to the cabin crew and chief Steward. She was a lone passenger so it appears that the ground crew lied about a couple wanting to sit together. Why should I be inconvenienced at the expense of others - am I not a passenger worthy of some dignity and respect? The service on this flight was at best sloppy and the crew seemed unpolished. Some were though to be fair so forgivable. But after the main course served the crew disappeared until time for a small second meal prior to landing which was a cold muffin and cold roll for breakfast - really bad! No orange juice, the crew just said don't have and that was it. No water runs between meals. Before landing crew collected the blankets and started to drag them around passengers and dumped into the toilets! Overall an average mediocre flight, crew service not very professional. I was so tired and exhausted from this flight. Emirates is dropping in standards.",5,28th February 2017,Singapore
1136,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Dublin. So impressed with my Emirates experience. From the minute we boarded the plane, the crew were professional and worked hard. Some fellow passengers were a little tricky to deal with but the crew dealt with them with great care and patience. We'll be flying Emirates again soon,they are much better than other airlines we've flown.",1,26th February 2017,Ireland
1137,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Brisbane. I flew with my toddler yesterday with Emirates on a long flight. I want to give very positive feedback to the crew on flight EK434 travelling to Brisbane on February 25th. Everyone was very courteous and attentive. My trip with a toddler was made comfortable thanks to the kind attendants. I will highly recommend Emirates to everyone from now on and look forward to travelling with you again in future. Thanks for excellent service.,3,26th February 2017,Australia
1138,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Manchester. Boarded the plane at the last minute owing to delayed previous flight. The cabin crew walked past me three times without offering a drink although on each occasion she had a tray full of drinks. I did eventually get a drink but only after I specifically asked for one. A380 seats for me are uncomfortable and claustrophobic. Cabin crew service was poor and disjointed with the majority of business class crew spending more time in the bar area chatting, at times outnumbering the passengers there. The main meal was very good although the wine service was poor. Again, the chocolates mentioned in the menu were absent as was ant offer of coffee after the meal. In flight entertainment was good. This was the sixth flight on business class with Emirates within four months and each time I have been very disappointed with the product. Service on the A380 seems to be very poor.",10,24th February 2017,United Kingdom
1139,"✅ Verified Review |  Phuket to Dubai. Aircraft boarding was haphazard but everyone was boarded 10 minutes before departure time. There was then a delay of over 1 hour as a mother informed cabin crew that her son was unwell. Eventually they were all offloaded and the flight departed 75 minutes late. During the delay we were asked what we wanted for a meal, both first and second choices were unavailable. Eventually I ended up having the lunch instead of breakfast which meant that there was not much choice for lunch. Cabin crew service was hit and miss. Seat comfort was acceptable and far better than those on the A380. No amenity packs were offered. Arriving at Dubai late we had 20 minutes to catch the connecting flight which entailed using the rail link and with faulty lifts in the terminal we just made the connection. Discounting the delay, I was not overly impressed with Emirates and thought that the flight was poor value for money.",8,24th February 2017,United Kingdom
1140,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Phuket via Dubai. Manchester check in and lounge very good. Boarded A380 seats 11E/F, not as originally booked as aircraft changed to an A380 from Boeing 777. Personally I find the A380 very claustrophobic and the seat most uncomfortable; there is limited room for elbows especially with the ICE tablet and seat divider screen getting in the way. No matter how much I tried, I could not get comfortable in the seat. Cabin crew were friendly on boarding but during the flight they seemed very elusive. A walk to the bar area on several occasions found that passengers in the bar outnumbered by cabin crew. Meals on this leg of the journey were less than memorable and service was poor; I am still waiting for the cheeseboard to be served even though I reminded cabin crew three times that I had not received it. And where is the chocolate that is mentioned on the menus but is noticeable by its absence? And there was no amenity kit provided, is this a cost cutting measure? On the Dubai to Phuket leg, the seats were much more comfortable for me than on the A380. The Boeing 777 was reasonably smart but was beginning to show signs of wear and tear, Cabin crew on this flight were OK but service was still below what it should be. Meals again were not too good, although we did get chocolates this time, but only because we asked specifically for them. An amenity kit was provided on this flight. In view of the cost of the tickets, I was disappointed at the level of service and the standard of food provided, although the Emirates lounge at Manchester had exceptionally good food on offer.",9,24th February 2017,United Kingdom
1141,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Bangkok. Flying with Emirates short haul appears cheaper than most low-cost airlines in Asia. Emirates provides full service, with generous luggage allowance (30kgs) on Economy Class. The food was great as one can choose vegetarian or low sodium diet. The cabin is so spacious. One can barely hear the noise from the engine and the flight is so smooth. We did not feel that the aircraft has taken off and landed already. The cabin crews are very attentive to the needs of the passengers. Aircraft is new and well-maintained. This is the second time I flew Emirates using A380 and I will definitely fly with them again.",10,23rd February 2017,Philippines
1142,"✅ Verified Review |  I have been taking Emirates service between Bangkok and Hong Kong a few times a year for more than 6 years. Little has changed (although on the more recent A380s there is unfortunately no side pocket for books, iPads etc.), the meals and wines remain very good, the bar at the back is excellent, service is efficient and the lounge offerings better than most airlines. Plus I love the aircraft. But I have to bring up two issues. The IFE Guide used to be user-friendly. Now the airline has jazzed it up, it is a design mess and extremely difficult to read! Movies have no timings. What is the point of that, especially for short flights? To find out timings you have to open each channel and wade through ads each time. So if you are considering which of 4 or 5 movies to select you waste a lot of time and patience with the added possibility you'll miss the end of the movie before landing. Then there are the audio programmes. Once again the classical music section used to be hugely comprehensive. Now it is another mess. What is the point of having a composer's name as the title of a channel - like just Mendelssohn or Mozart - when the works being performed are not listed? Do we have to check the screen every time? If so, then even that often does not provide the information. Wagner wrote operas and so is understandably included in the Opera section (although with no works listed). Yet he also appears in the non-operatic section. To find out what that included, I started the channel. Nothing on the screen gave me any clue what was about to be played. Never mentioned anywhere is the fact it is the opera Das Rheingold - almost two and a half hours non-stop music and singing! No indication either of artists, conductors and orchestras, all of interest to those listening. Something really has to be done to include more pertinent accurate detail in the Guide. My other disappointment was having foregone the meal and watched a movie, when it was over I went to the bar to get some canapés. As I went to the nearby toilet to wash my hands, there were plenty available. Less than 45 seconds later, everything had been dumped into the trash bins - even though there were still 35 minutes of the flight remaining and drinks were still being served. Surely you don't get rid of bar offerings so quickly - at least until the descent has started!",1,22nd February 2017,Thailand
1143,"✅ Verified Review |  Hong Kong to Dubai. They blocked seats so when I tried to check in online 48hr before, I was stuck in the seat they assigned me. We were a family of four travelling together. We were separated in the huge A380. I cannot move our family to sit together or even close by. I called the customer service, and also raised my concern with their social media team, the feedback I got was that all passengers had already checked in by then - which was ridiculous. And they refused to help. Their staff told me, in a quite rude way, that I should've paid a lot more for a better cabin. Second, on the flight from Dubai to Hong Kong, they ran out of food (food, not food selection) when the trolly reached me. I asked why this happened since there was fixed number of passengers/seats on board, and the flight attendant, at first, said that this should be expected by passengers, and asked if I wanted to have cup noodle instead. Until later she said that was a mistake. She then offered me one sandwich and said to me that it supposed to be staff's meal but I can take it (any staff will have no meal during the flight?) I refused. Later on when they started to collect left-overs, miraculously, the flight attendant 'found' one meal and wanted to offer to me. This is disgusting. This is simply the worst experience ever.",7,21st February 2017,Hong Kong
1144,"✅ Verified Review |  To me, Emirates hasn't changed much since my last trip with them in 2013. It still offers free train ticket (in Germany) that connects your home to the airport. Flights from Munich to Beijing via Dubai were on-time. Onboard service was great with a good selection of food and alcoholic/non-alcoholic drinks. I went for some vodka and they served me Russian Standard, a premium vodka distilled in St. Petersburg. That was a pleasant surprise. The only downside of the trip was Munich airport. Emirates uses Munich's Terminal 1, which is very outdated and small, especially so when being compared to Munich airport's new Terminal 2. On our way back, at Munich there were only 3 immigration windows and a small luggage carousel for the 500 passengers from a fully packed A380.",1,18th February 2017,Germany
1145,"✅ Verified Review |  Larnaca to Malta. This is the only way to get to Malta from Cyprus and it isn't a bad option. Bought a coach ticket and a few days before EK sent an email for an upgrade to Business for Euro 320. One-way business fare is Euro 800 so I thought what the heck - I'll do it. You get neither the car service pick-up nor access to the business class lounge - it's stated when you buy the upgrade - but I think I wouldn't do it again as it's totally ridiculous not to give you lounge access. Check-in was friendly and flight boarded on-time. They use the 7-across business Boeing 777-300ER for this route which is false advertising as the upgrade email said lie-flat seats in private all aisle-access seating. But I had the seat next to me free and enjoyed the space. ICE is always the best of any airline so can't fault entertainment system. Service - the key point - was the downfall. The FA serving my side was lacking much personality, hard to get her to smile but I did manage it once. The male FA was mostly flirting with the lady passengers behind me and not until we lifted off did he come by and introduce himself. Food was average - had the same in coach on other airlines. Cabin was clean and again seat was comfortable for the 2 1/2 hour trip. Landed on time but priority bags came out last - which was a pain as I had a car waiting for over an hour after I landed. Overall it was fine but I would not pay for full Biz Class on any EK flight. They really don't offer the high level of service that they show on TV.",9,18th February 2017,United States
1146,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Male via Dubai. I am sitting in the Maldives a day later than I was supposed to arrive waiting for a sea plane for two hours, because Emirates overbooked my flight from Dubai to the Maldives. They kicked my husband and I off the flight with absolutely no other option. So we had to get up at 1am and take 4:30am flight to get into the Maldives a day late. Their rude clerks informed me this was my only option. Since we had to reschedule our sea plane to our island, I am stuck at another airport waiting for hours since all flights for today were already booked. Oh did I mention this is supposed to be my honeymoon. Emirates cost me a day and a half at my beach resort on my honeymoon. Their consolation round trip tickets are all well and good except I don't have any time off of work to travel again, and we really can't afford another vacation.  Their airline is supposed to be elite, but my experience has been inconvenient, rude, frustrating, demeaning, and enraging. This is unacceptable.",6,17th February 2017,United States
1147,"Dublin to Singapore via Dubai. Service not very pleasant and mainly in Dublin airport the Emirates staff were quite unfriendly - all this from check in up to getting to the plane, was reminding me the situation from maybe 3-4 years ago with Ryanair. But Emirates is not low cost company! The service and food onboard also nothing extra special.",4,17th February 2017,Ireland
1148,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Emirates from Dubai to London Heathrow. Four hour delay before take-off due to a technical problem only apparent after we had taxied to the runway for take-off. Food service offered but never materialised. Child meals later provided were unhealthy and inedible. During both legs of the flight there was a mad panic from the aircrew attempting to ready the cabin for landing as if this had been delayed until the last possible moment. The flight deck reminding them that we were at 10000 feet and they really ought to be sitting down. At the end of the flight there was an announcement that 'I hope the delay hasn't caused too much inconvenience' Really? Arriving home at 1am instead of 9pm with young children? Missing the last tube? Glib nonsense.

1149,"✅ Verified Review |  Flown with Emirates a few years ago and it was great. But this time, Emirates what has happened to you. The Glasgow leg I was so disappointed with no hot towels and very few drink runs. Ran out of meal choice of Lamb and crew looked disinterested. Was not looking forward to second leg of the journey. When my wife and I checked in they could not confirm that we would be sitting together on the second leg even though we had booked six months ago. Then it all changed, when a very helpful gent at the Emirates counter sorted us out with new boarding passes. It was the game changer for us. We got the best seats in the house right at front of plane 41a and 41b they were great. Food was great plenty of drinks runs, this crew were on the ball. The leading cabin Steward was very efficient in his duties and his manners were impeccable. Live Football, Wifi what a great product you have in the A380. Really enjoyed my time on your flagship route to Auckland. Will be looking forward to using you again.

1150,"✅ Verified Review | Newcastle to Bahrain via Dubai. I have made 5 trips with Emirates in the last 15 months, made up of 20 flights. There has been a steady decline in quality and the service provided. It seems that Emirates is becoming a budget hub operator. The prices have stayed the similar, however with saver fares you must pay to select your seat before check in. This wouldn't be too bad, but Emirates don't allow the purchase of exit seats which is bad compared to other carriers. The choice of drinks onboard has decreased and certain routes have had snacks removed, which existed before. It seems the cabin crew are not as courteous as I first experienced and even seem slightly unprofessional. My biggest complaint is that they cancelled one of my flights, gave me an alternative that got me to my destination 24 hours late. After calling them they changed it to the earlier flight meaning I'd make my connection. The way they came across on the phone was that I should be grateful they changed it for free. Now I had a long connection in Dubai and asked for lounge access as a form of compensation, which they refused. They said waiving the cost of changing my flight was my compensation. Changing the flight in the first place was their fault. Also, when I landed in Bahrain it took nearly an hour and half for my luggage and there was still half the passengers waiting when I left. Overall, a budget choice if you have no other option. Emirates is very much a last option for myself now.",7,16th February 2017,United Kingdom

First of all the staff took over an hour for the trays to be cleared leaving us highly uncomfortable in our seats. The hostess snapped at me when I asked for the trays to be cleared reporting that she has 400 passengers to cater for.

Boarding was very punctual and well organised. Warm welcome from the excellent cabin crew when I boarded and throughout the flight the cabin crew was just lovely and very attentive. Seats on the A380 are so comfortable and the IFE is just brilliant. There was just not enough time to watch all the new releases. The food was absolutely delicious (I had salmon and saffron rice), the service impeccable and the flight overall just amazing.

After reminding the steward that I wanted eyeshades twice, I never got them!  After landing in Islamabad, the next day I used Emirates online complaint system and wrote them a detailed picture of what happened. I get an email from Emirates in which I was addressed by a wrong name, indicating that the whole complaint reply process just involved cut and paste functions.

Particularly like that the entertainment system is working as soon as you enter the plane. Plenty of hot towels throughout the flights. Downside would be the soups which were served either lukewarm or cold and the showers within the A lounge, which were dirty with mould staining. Highlight was the fish starter.

Chauffeur service very efficient and no delays on either flight despite late departures from both airports.",10,9th February 2017,United Kingdom
1157,"✅ Verified Review |  Warsaw to Hanoi via Dubai. There was a significance difference in the quality of service between the 2 flights. The mainly Polish crew on the Warsaw to Dubai leg were quite abrupt and rude. The chief purser seemed very stressed and the crew did not seem professional at all. The TV screens were also quite old and not very responsive. The Dubai to Hanoi leg was much better. We had more comfortable seats towards the rear of the plane and the crew were excellent. Especially, the Brazilian flight attendant who saw we were trying to take a selfie and kindly offered to take the photo herself. Her colleague even went and pulled down all the window blinds in the last few rows to make the photo clearer. I was seriously impressed with this level of attentiveness. So overall, Emirates is a bit of a mixed bag in terms of the quality of the staff. Some are amazing, others mediocre at best - and some downright rude.",6,8th February 2017,Poland
1158,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Manila. I am a first time Emirates passenger. Boarding process was disorganized. Flight attendants seemed tired and never smiled. Even if I said thank you, not even a single response, just nothing.  There was no amenity kit given to Economy passengers. Food was so-so.

The cabin crew on both flights were friendly as professional. A complimentary play kit was provided to the child. Our seats in both flights were on row 44 (economy starts at row 41) so we were in front of engines allowing a very quite and comfortable flight. Entertaining system boasts loads of movies, music, video and other information (also 3 real cameras). Meals were served prior to children and other special requests menu.

After our Qantas flight was cancelled we ended up at the Emirates desk being checked in for EK413 to Sydney the check in assistant was very empathetic after our traumatic experience. We have flown Emirates before and had reservations which had led us to avoid them for this trip to New Zealand. Unfortunately even though they were very good to accommodate us the same problems resurfaced. The plane was brilliant, newer than the one we flew on in 2014 with a brilliant seat and inflight entertainment. The main problem is with the service and staff. Business class was no more than two thirds full but we were told that our meal selection was unavailable. When I informed the attendant that I did not eat either of the alternatives she said she would see what she could do. Her solution was to give me an economy main course, and not having enough food to fulfil all requests is unacceptable. The staff seemed disorganised and some had a poor grasp of English. My wife and I asked two simple questions of the attendants, one did not know and the other did not understand and had to get a senior. I did not have a dedicated attendAnt for sake of continuity and was served by 4 different people. No hot drinks were served after the meal. If you are paying a business class fare you expect value for money. I know we were transferred at short notice but by taking us we were still entitled to expect certain standards.",5,5th February 2017,United Kingdom

Usual variable cabin crew with BKK routes so-so, but much more attentive crews on the Glasgow legs. Economy class food seems to be improving in recent years though I think the IFE choice of films is not as good as it was. No remote stand bussing in DXB which is an improvement.

I could have routed through Doha or Abu Dhabi, but Emirates was a little cheaper for business class and now I know why. The Boeing 777 had seats in this cabin arranged 2x3x2, and being in the middle block I couldn't believe how cramped, uncomfortable and positively horrible this is. One expects this from premium economy, but not business. The IFE was okay, but I had expected something much more and realised they bulk up the quantity by many multi national offerings and a plethora of old (not proper classic) movies that other airlines wouldn't bother with. The cabin staff performed their duties, not with any friendliness or courtesy, and I'm glad my return route flights are arranged with China Southern who at least offer proper flat bed seats and comfort in business class.

From smooth check-in in Zurich through to transit in Dubai and a short connecting flight to Muscat, where we were served a snack and coffee / tea on a 35 minute flight, everything was perfect. The meal from Zurich to Dubai was delicious. I had ordered beef and it was tender and tasty. The cabin crew on both flights were very friendly, attentive and helpful. My seat on the A380 was very comfortable and inflight entertainment kept me entertained.

At Heathrow we checked-in 3 hours in advance and it was very easy, however the staff didn't seem that engaging with the customer or enthusiastic, so I felt a bit dissatisfied. Check-in at the gate was also speedy considering the size of the aircraft. You get your passport checked before being called in for boarding. Again similar experience with the staff - no eye contact, no smile, and very low voice.  Boarding was well managed, my seat was on row 83. Very pleased with the seat size, legroom and overall cabin space. I consider myself to have long legs (183cm height) Food was excellent, metal cutlery and little details like chocolate and small snacks complement the meal well. The red wine was a highlight for me.

1167,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Perth via Dubai. Emirates do not care and customer service is a joke. I received a bland apology and they flatly denied I was booked in as vegetarian, something which I double checked as I booked through an agent. Unfortunately I was served vegan food, which was appalling. They tried to serve the same dreadful dishes twice on the same trip. Not the gourmet food promised on their website. The cabin crew did their best to rustle up something edible, but when I finally was served a vegetarian meal on the last flight of the trip - a meal which had been rejected by another passenger - it was a very hot, spicy chick pea meal with a raw chilli in it. Not everyone reacts well to hot spicy food and I am one of them. Dubai Airport is a disgrace - the customer service staff were surly and unhelpful. I was not advised that there was a business lounge nearer to my boarding gate, (the gate number was on the pass, so that would not have been difficult) resulting in a long, last minute dash to the gate. On the return flight, finding the correct lounge was nigh impossible, and I and another passenger had to ask a cleaner as no customer service staff were anywhere to be seen. The signage was inadequate. As for the Fast Track passes handed out on both the flights, these were meaningless and we were herded through with the rest of the passengers. A 15 minute (at least) bus ride from the plane to the terminal was the last straw. To summarise I paid three times the economy price for a lie flat bed and a few glasses of champagne. Not the exciting, wonderful experience promised by Emirates, and they are so big they really do not care.",2,28th January 2017,United Kingdom

The cabin crew were very helpful on both legs of the journey and provided much better service on both legs than on recent trips. In particular, they accommodated a small bamboo stool (souvenir) that was marginally over the luggage dimensions though fitted OK into the larger overhead lockers (ground staff wanted to put it in the hold). They also greeted me by name on the DXB-MAN flight and offered to show me how all the seat / screen controls worked. The seats were very comfy on both the new Boeing 777 (RGN-DXB) and the older A380 (DXB-MAN). I asked to change my breakfast from Express to Continental and the cabin crew agreed immediately. The food is never exceptional on Emirates but it was tasty. The New Zealand Pinot Noir wine was excellent. The cabin crew were very attentive in bringing and removing towels / food and drink. I didn't manage to connect to wifi, though this sometimes depends which country we are over.",2,23rd January 2017,United Kingdom
1171,"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates was simply brilliant. I flew four flights with them in a week, London Heathrow to Mumbai via Dubai, returning from Delhi to London via Dubai, and all flights were perfect. The sector DEL to DXB was delayed as Delhi airport authorities decided to shut the airport for an hour due to national day preparations so we sat there for an hour meaning that the time at Dubai for connecting my onward flight was minimal. However Emirates pulled it out of the bag and I made my connecting flight and my bags were there at Heathrow as well! Despite flying economy my seat was comfortable with plenty of legroom, the entertainment was superb with thousands of films and TV programmes to watch and the food was fine. The flight attendants were friendly and efficient, especially those from Europe and South East Asia. I have no hesitation in flying with Emirates again.",10,23rd January 2017,United Kingdom
1172,"✅ Verified Review | Cape Town to Sydney via Dubai. Emirates has to be the worst airline I have ever travelled with. They state on your ticket that you are allowed 30kg of checked in baggage. However, when you check in this changes to two 23kg bags. Now because most passengers are over 23kg and are not in a position to buy a new bag at the airport, they let you ""get out"" of the dilemma by paying $75 (USA). Most passengers I met on board stated they had to pay this amount. When myself and the other passengers inquired about this amount to ground staff, we were all rudely told ""you need to read the fine print and that it a new Emirates policy"". I was also shouted at by the senior manager in Cape Town because I asked him to explain why this policy was in place. After we argued for almost 30 mins, he turned to the other ground staff and started laughing. They also ran out of food and I had to miss dinner despite paying for this service. Staff on board also don't seem to like their job as they don't respond to the assistance light and frequently forget what they told you. As a frequent traveller to all parts of the world, this is the worst airline I have ever flown. Emirates has become an arrogant airline which now seems to accept bad service and rude staff. I will never travel with them ever again.",4,20th January 2017,Australia
1173,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai. Travelled on the evening flight from the UK, transitting Dubai mid morning with the Brisbane leg being a night flight. Good points - prompt chauffer service at both ends, good lounge at Gatwick with reasonable range of food, wide range of films and the entertainment system is available as soon as you board, heated towels at regular intervals, comfy seating with mattress topper for sleep, fast track security pass. Negatives - patchy on board service, untidy and tired looking plane on the Brisbane leg, lack of sleep suits. Major problem was the transfer at Dubai. Gatwick flight's arrival into Terminal A was delayed by over an hour due to fog. We then found that the Brisbane flight was leaving from Terminal B, a train ride away where the Business Lounge is much poorer than in A. Due to restricted time for transfer my wife did not use the shower facility, the gents was ok but tiny cubicle. Went to the Boarding Gate on time but plane was parked off stand on the other side of the airport. Bus transfer needed and chaos seemed to ensue. We were at least an hour in the lounge/queuing on the stairs - not acceptable for business customers. Plane was then delayed leaving Dubai and arrived at Brisbane about 2 hours late. This created issues with our ongoing transfer. We are hoping that our return to the UK in Feb will not suffer the same delays.",7,16th January 2017,United Kingdom
1174,"✅ Verified Review | Savannah to Cochin via New York JFK and Dubai. Emirates has collaborated with Jetblue to allow seamless transitions between continents. However, the Emirates website was not updated to include the courtesy layover package (visa on arrival / hotel) for the 14 hours we were forced to stay in the airport, waiting for our connection. We tried a lot to reason with the online customer service and ground staff but they refused to work around the issue. We were travelling with a 1 year old and it was a miserable 14 hours. After the long wait in the terminal, we had to board a 13 hour flight to New York which unnecessarily made our travel very hectic. There was an earlier flight to New York but ground staff refused. They were rude and belittling, likely due to lack of sensitivity training. They spoke broken English and got aggravated when asked to repeat. We expected them to take responsibility for the website flaw and treat our family with respect.",3,15th January 2017,United States

Flew Emirates from Dubai to Mumbai. Frequent flyer with Emirates. Modern aircrafts with the best inflight entertainment and good meals. Dedicated terminal in Dubai with excellent facilities. Overall comfortable. Snobbish staff. Worst thing about this airline - Stingy on drinks on Dubai-Mumbai route. Almost all flights on Dubai-Mumbai routes are always delayed by 30 mins. Offers very expensive tickets on long routes compared to other airlines, taking advantage of being able to offer those routes non-stop.

1176,"✅ Verified Review |  Pure nightmare. I travelled with a 4yrs old who has special needs. I was allocated a seat in the upper deck which is close to business class. My seat was changed a few minutes before boarding with this unbelievable reason “your child has autism so he can’t seat near the business area”! We were then moved to the lower deck to the end of the plane (from 27 to 87) where we could enjoy the toilet flushing sound throughout the 7hrs flight from Dubai to Birmingham. Not only that I was relying on my son’s pushchair as he gets tired walking long distance. They lost the first pushchair on the way to Dubai, texted me the next day and asked me to collect it, had to take taxi from Sharjah to Dubai, waited in the lost luggage office for hours to be told the text message was wrong and they haven’t yet found the pushchair. Ok, organized another pushchair and this was again lost on the way back to Birmingham. I have been calling their call center for the last 10 days, every time talked to a new person but same reply, “we will email Birmingham airport, they will get back to you”!  So far nothing has happened and I had to buy a new pushchair for my son. ",10,13th January 2017,United Kingdom

Fortunately, my new year's eve flight was one of the best I've ever had in years. Very friendly, hard-working and charming team of international crew, a medium load, free wifi for 10 mb, or only USD1 for 500 mb, all made for a great journey. Catering standard was better than average, a great choice of drinks and wine etc. The bar at the back of the upper deck is a must do. A lot of passengers went to sleep, I was having fun with the crew counting down to the new year, a first for me on the air! If ever there was one minor imperfection, that would be the dining table of my seat, which was badly designed in a way, when opened and folded down, it cuts almost into my stomach (I am stocky). Dining was not exactly comfortable with this fatal design fault. I took one mark off because of that. Otherwise, it's a perfect 10 from me.",10,11th January 2017,Hong Kong
1178,"✅ Verified Review |  Hyderabad to London via Dubai. After being advised that I could change my flight for my return journey, I managed to find a flight earlier and tried to pay for the ticket using my UK card, (for which I got charged for a failed transaction), Two credit cards from India and failed. There was money in the accounts but they couldn't take the money. I was advised to bring in cash to the airport on the day of travel. So I painstakingly managed to get 20,000 Rupees when currency was scarce in India and took it to the airport. The rude woman over the phone at the airport Emirates office just said she couldn't take my money because the call centre people didn't put the amount to pay on the ticket but it was confirmed conditionally? Didn't get that logic at all. So I had to call the call centre after putting some more credit as the average call time for a call to Emirates is a minimum of half an hour to an hour. Then the manager comes on the phone and directs me to someone else in the airport. I was due to fly at 9:20pm and hadn't paid for my ticket until 7:15 pm. I was scared to death as I had to report to work the next day.  The casual and careless attitude of the Emirates airport staff didn't help relieve the tension. Somehow after going through so many people and so many phone calls I have finally managed to pay for my ticket and nearly didn't get my change if I didn't impose on it. It has been an absolute nightmare journey with Emirates. ",8,9th January 2017,United Kingdom
1179,"✅ Verified Review |  My flight from Dublin to Hong Kong via Dubai was pleasant. The flight is good value for money, cheaper than flights that I used to go on that connect through Heathrow. I felt the service was standard and comparable to other airlines I have flown long haul. The journey is split into two 8 hours flights with a layover between. Due to the timing of the dinner and breakfast service, getting a long period of rest was difficult. They were slow to turn off the cabin lights to allow passengers to rest. In the past when I went through Heathrow I felt the crew were quicker to serve the first meal and served the last meal much closer to landing, maximising the rest period. And they were quicker to turn off lights. In my second leg from Dubai to Hong Kong, a child had vomited at the back of the plane by the lavatory. The crew seemed to struggle to come up with a way to deal with it but they improvised in the end.

1181,"✅ Verified Review |  Seattle to Thiruvananthapuram via Dubai.  I was travelling with my kids, which includes an infant. The staff on the flight from Seattle to Dubai were rude and non-cooperative. I requested for warm water to prepare some food for my kid and it was provided after 2 hrs even after me telling them in the first place that it is for the infant's meal. At the airport just before boarding they made a fuss about my one cabin baggage being 8 kg and wanted me to move the 1 kg to another bag even though the total weight of the baggage's were less than the allowed weight limit for 3 people.  I had requested special meals due to some dietary requirements. The tray was provided well before the meal was served to rest of the passengers. With a one year old how many hours can I handle the tray? On requesting the crew member to help me out by taking the tray the response was we cannot do it as we are serving other passengers. All of them responded in a very arrogant manner. The passenger who was sitting on the aisle seat was so accommodating that he agreed to switch seats with me seeing my plight. I had to go to the kitchen area to get warm water every single time with my little one. The screen in-front of my seat was not working. I just wanted it to be switched off. The crew member said it will be done in 5 minutes and that he will be back in 5 minutes. Apparently he came after 5 hrs. The airlines says that they take care of people who are travelling with kids which is not true. The other passengers (elder people) were so kind that they offered to hold the baby for a few minutes so that I can use the restroom. On our return flight, I had requested for gluten-free meal which was provided in the flight from TRV to Dubai but was denied on the flight from Dubai to Seattle stating that I had not made the choice, even though i had opted for it in all the flights to and fro. I do want to thank the crew on the flight from Dubai to Thiruvananthapuram who were helpful and accommodating. They helped me out without even requesting.

1182,"✅ Verified Review |  It would seem to me that Emirates have spent all their money on advertising and celeb associations while overlooking the upkeeping of their planes or training their staff. My return flight London to Melbourne was one of the worst flight related experiences I've been through and a huge disappointment. One half of the entertainment screen on the first leg of the journey (LHR to DXB) was unresponsive so I gave up on trying to watch anything. The provided headphones are awful, and you can't use you own because of the archaic two ports stereo jack they work with. The food was simply awful on 4 of the 5 flight legs on my journey. Apart from the crackers and cheese, I ate next to nothing. Airport staff are incredibly slow at doing anything. Just one example: boarding our connecting flight in Singapore, they chose to guide all the 800 or so passengers onto the plane by having a junior member of staff hold boards with the boarding zones up. If you haven't been in the Singapore airport before, you'll probably not know that a huge part of the seating area at the boarding gate is behind the counter, so if you were sitting there, you couldn't see the boards at all, while another member of staff was trying to shout what zones were being boarded when. This confused a lot of people, that simply couldn't hear or see what was being announced. The worst is yet to come, as our return flight MEL to DXB was delayed by two hours due to fog on an earlier flight, this made us miss our connecting flights in Dubai. You'd think that, with such a big airline as Emirates everything would be fine as they surely have other flights to go onto. You would be wrong though, we were rebooked onto a flight the next morning, so 45 people on the London flight alone were stuck in Dubai for a full day. Again, staff were slow taking more than an hour to process the 10 of us in the queue.",9,6th January 2017,United Kingdom

However, flight from Islamabad to Dubai was ok even though the airplane was not very clean. Staff was cooperative. But as soon as we landed in Dubai, we were like stranded. There was no counter or any staff to help us or guide us. The fellow passengers were helpful enough to guide us. We had 18 hrs connecting flight to Bologna. It took us more than a hour to find the Emirates counter regarding hotel room. My mother cannot walk a lot. Finally when we found the counter and asked for hotel room, Emirates staff was rude and denied us room. Finally, seeing condition of my mother I offered to pay for the room. Even then, the woman sitting on counter said her shift was over and she wont help us out; we should wait till after 5 (our flight landed in Duabi at 3:00PM). After waiting for almost an hour the Emirates took around 1100 Dirhams from us for one night stay (visa fee included). But all this process took around 4 hrs as we reached hotel at 7:30 PM , extremely exhausted. When we thought all that was bad was behind us, the flight to Bologna turned out to be even a worse experience. The air hostesses were not cooperative at all.

Once airside, boarding was not announced until 13:45 and flight departed at 15:00. There were many Emirates staff hanging around at the gate but no one bothered to make an announcement. Clearly Bangkok's gate holding lounges are not designed to accommodate a full load of A380 passengers and it was jam packed. No effort was made by the Emirates ground staff to separate passengers. Boarding at the beginning was a free flow until several very sultry ground staff restored order. Once on board, cabin crew was cold. The lady responsible for the area I sat in was very rude with people that do not speak fluent English when distributing the 'meal' (tasteless and cold curry chicken rice) and if you dare to ask her for something she does not have in the trolley (Diet Coke for example), the request would fall on deaf ear. Despite such rudeness, service was slow and inefficient. They only served the meal one hour after take off and barely managed to collect the trays at top of descent.

Booked online thinking they are a 'premium airline' that offers great all-round service and the flights they had would get us home a bit quicker than our usual airline so we took a chance. Booking went smoothly until we tried to select seats! Couldn't select first leg at all (understandable as with another airline and of course directed to that airline that didn't even recognise the booking!). Second leg booked seats together OK. But site wouldn't give access to third leg - Dubai to Perth. Kept trying and after day of trying got access. 5 seats left and none together! You have to be joking. Booking made as two people. So they get your money but then you can't even sit together. Absolute joke Emirates. Needless to say we won't ever use Emirates again. We will stick to our usual airline in future.

The entertainment is excellent, the food is good, the seat is comfortable, the aircraft is clean, the staff are okay. My flight from Paris to Dubai was delayed 3 hours because of bad weather. The ground staff at Paris reassured us that we will be taken care of if we missed our connecting flight. We landed at Dubai at about 10.20 pm instead of the scheduled 9.40 pm. We need about 5-10 minutes to get off the plane and proceed to the transit area. There were 2 staff holding boards, for the Bangkok flight passengers and other destination. We checked the departure screen and read that our connecting flight was boarding. All of the Kuala Lumpur flight passengers ran to the gate, just to know that the flight had departed at 10.30 pm. We were very shocked. If it had waited 10 more minutes, all of the passangers would not be stranded at the Dubai airport, on new years eve. We were forced to queue at the ground office for hours to find our flight home. My family got lucky. We got our flight home after standing for 2 and a half hours. We were rerouted, flying from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur via Dhaka, using Bangladesh Airlines. We paid for Emirates, got Biman and extra trouble of tracing our baggage. Amazing way to start the year.

So when we arrived in Krabi minus our luggage because that was left in Bangkok due to the late arrival our our Dubai flight I emailed Emirates only to be told it could have been operational reasons we were bumped, but I feel really strongly that we are being fobbed off by them. Why bother giving you the option to book seats then move you anyway. What makes another passenger better than me and why should they get the seat I'd booked all those months in advance. I have since replied to them and asked the question again. I think the cabin crew are not as attentive as they used to be either. I know to some people the seat saga is petty but it's a big thing to me. All I hope is we get the seats we booked on our return flights.

We have always had good experience with check-in, boarding and disembarkment. So when I had an accident during our last trip to Thailand and broke my ankle, I was fitted with an Aircast so that I could fly home. My insurance was taking care of everything but the one thing they refused, no matter how many times I asked or even with a written statement from my doctor, was to upgrade my husband so that he could be by my side during the long and uncomfortable journey home. I was unable to walk unaided and therefore needed personal assistance. I was upgraded to Business Class, which would have been a great experience under any other circumstances. As it was I daren't eat or drink much of what was on offer (all looked delicious) out of fear of being caught short bathroom wise. The Bangkok to Dubai leg in Business Class was full admittedly, but the Dubai to Gatwick leg was only half occupied.

On the other side, the ICE system was excellent, with a great selection of movies, documentaries and games.The food was above average. The FA's were efficient, very helpful and with a smile. On the outbound flight, we had a 9 hour layover in Dubai, so the airline provided us a free hotel at the in Copthorne airport hotel, just 5 mins drive from the airport, with breakfast included.

1194,"✅ Verified Review |  I took a first class ticket Dubai to Kuwait, but overall I was disappointed with the experience. First, my chauffeur driver never informed the hotel that he was waiting for me outside as I instructed EK to do so via my telephone conversation in Dubai. I had no idea he was waiting for me outside. The first class check-in experience was not as tremendous as I anticipated. Basically there was attention given to me, but I never felt like a first class passenger. They let me check-in in the express check-in counter as opposed to the first class counter. The food and service provided in the first class lounge in concourse A is unacceptable. Not only was the food tasteless, but it takes a very long time to prepare something for me from a la carte menu. For example, it took approximately 10 - 15 minutes to provide me my club sandwich, and 15 - 20 minutes to provide me the ""um ali"" sweet. All this while the lounge was empty. While I was waiting for my food the waiter asked me what I wanted to drink and I told him water, he kept goofing around and I chased him until he gave me my water. This is unacceptable for first class service. During boarding business class passengers entered door 1A with us as opposed to door 2A, thus ruining the exclusive experience of first class. Upon disembark, business class passengers were trying to skip queue and leave the aircraft before first class passengers do.  I will not be flying Emirates first class again and will look for alternatives such as Qatar Airways.

1195,✅ Verified Review |  Mumbai to London via Dubai. Wasn't the greatest experience with Emirates - check in was a headache. We were 8 kilos overweight between two of us and they charged us for the excess. Boarding was fine and seats comfortable but they feel a little claustrophobic. The staff were good. My wife was charmed by her attendant but I got the feeling my attendant thought she was doing me a favour by serving me. It doesn't cost any thing and takes minimal effort to smile when talking to a customer. Meals were only served within a timeslot so you couldn't eat when you wanted to and weren't really up to expectations. The champagne wasn't served cold enough. I had to return 3 glasses and in the end I went to the bar myself to make sure. The bar itself was a bit of a disappointment but maybe we were too tired to appreciate it. The seat has an area with a selection of soft drinks which you can access yourself. Unfortunately its protective frame needed two arms to prise up and then the drinks weren't cold so I had to call for ice. The entertainment system was a bit tricky to operate and took a little while to work the IFE. The upper deck of business class probably had 100 passengers in total and felt a little overwhelming.  I felt that there were not enough attendants for the number they were taking care of. There were 4 loos between us but the loos were just a bit larger than the economy toilets and disappointing. I couldn't use one because it was too messed up. When we landed no attendant offered to help my wife with her luggage from the overhead locker but it was nice to have our own upper deck exit way. On reading through this I do sound a bit like a spoiled brat and complaining over small things. But if some airlines can get these right so why not Emirates? The entire business and first class were sold out on every leg we travelled so they have plenty of customers who are happy with Emirates product.,1,26th December 2016,United Kingdom
1196,"✅ Verified Review |  This was the 2nd leg of our journey from Gatwick to Ho Chi Minh City with Emirates, the first having been on a A380. We arrived in the morning local time and left in the morning local time. The food on the first leg was ok - not brilliant, but not awful just average. When we got on the next flight we were served a seafood lunch, at 9 am (ish) local time or 6 am as per our body clocks. Needless to say it remained untouched. Can't fathom why a lunch was served so early in the day. The bus from terminal to plane was extraordinarily long and seemed to take for ever but was most definitely at least 20-25 mins. The aircraft itself was definitely very dated and the seats far from the best. All in all it was a distinctly average experience and isn't likely to encourage us to use Emirates in the future. Having said all of that it was relatively cheap for Business class so I guess in this instance you sort of get what you pay for.

Really bad food on the flights - so much so that for much of the flight I stayed hungry. I am not particularly finicky about food. This is not an issue with Dubai to India (shorter flight) but a real issue for SFO to DXB. On this occasion I swapped my Business class seat with my wife's economy class. Extremely rude staff, started an argument whether I can visit my wife in business class. This was lodged as a complaint with Emirates but I did not hear anything in the last 3 months. So rude staff, and ineffective management that does nothing even on feedback. Wife was pregnant and unwell, threw up on the flight in the Business class seat and requested that I be called from the economy section for a few minutes. The confused staff bumbled around for a few minutes and did nothing.  ",1,24th December 2016,United States

Flight from JFK to Dubai was okay but the flight from Dubai to Chennai was worse. IFE was not so responsive and did not have extensive collection. Food was just okay (opted for asian vegetarian). I am a pure vegetarian and I pre ordered it while booking tickets. But crew told vegetarian meal was not available when coming to me and then I have to argue with them to get my vegetarian meal. Overall average experience for a world class airline - I had been in Qatar Airways before and it was way better.",1,23rd December 2016,United States
1199,"✅ Verified Review |  I recently traveled from Singapore to New York Via Dubai on Emirates. This was my third time flying with Emirates, and the service did not change. The cabin crew was very attentive and helpful. The ICE entertainment system is still one of the best airline entertainment systems. Economy class in the A380 is one of the best aircraft when it comes to economy travel. Very spacious and comfortable. The food was excellent, and the presentation was traditional but effective. I would recommend Emirates.",1,22nd December 2016,United States
1200,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew from London Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai, returning via Singapore and Dubai. My flight from Gatwick to DXB was extremely pleasant, entertainment was great, the A380 was excellent. Food was great as well, I cleared all the meals. The disappointing part of the journey were the cabin crew, they just didn't seem available and welcoming. They just seemed to be very tired and were too much involved and busy in chatting among themselves. Overall this leg was great, apart from the cabin crew. DXB to BNE was even worse in that field, the flight was already very long, which was stressful enough. I had a massive headache, and when I consulted one member of the cabin crew (she was a supervisor), she just told me to go back to my seat and watch movies, as they offered lots of choice. And that annoyed me, I thought cabin crew were supposed to be of support during a flight. The return flights from BNE to SIN, SIN to DXB were excellent, and even the crew were excellent and seemed professional and friendly. No comment on the DXB to LGW flight as it was well packed, so the cabin crew were busy - other than that I slept the whole flight so can't say much.",4,22nd December 2016,United Kingdom

I talk with supervisor who says sorry you can't to get this fly, you can go on next flight and will give you free ticket for 1 year or refund money. I infom him I came to the counter before it closes and again he says sorry we cant help you.

1202,"✅ Verified Review |  I booked the flights from Manchester to Melbourne via Dubai through Carlton leisure and was surprised that Qantas Airways were working in partnership with Emirates. The flight I am reviewing is flight Manchester to Dubai on 6th November. The seats were comfortable and there was plenty of room to move around during the flight. However it was very obvious that the crew were struggling to provide a service. The flight lasted for 8 hours and within that time we only recived 2 cups of water, which had to be asked for. Once the meals were brought round, I was told that there were no more of what I wanted and had to settle for a the second choice. A few minutes later I saw one of the cabin crew serving my original choice and asked if I could change my meal. The reply from the cabin crew was that it was the last one. On opening the meal it looked as if it had been put through a blender and only ate half of the meal due to the fact that I was so hungry with only two cup of water previously.  My partner and I will not be flying with Emirates again.",9,19th December 2016,United Kingdom

Now Emirates operates only 777s and A380s the product is very consistent and particularly welcomed on these shorter flights. Warm and friendly crew, aircraft in good condition and a choice of Rose or Brut champagne plus juices before take off. A pleasant hot breakfast was served and the crew remained visible and active throughout the flight. Washrooms were kept spotless and well stocked with amenities including Bulgari cologne. The only negative was that we were delayed waiting for late passengers which meant we lost our slot and consequentially were 30 minutes late arriving at Cairo. I regularly fly all 3 Gulf airlines and Emirates offers a superior product in both economy and business class.",3,12th December 2016,United Arab Emirates

This time the meal DXB to LGW was very poor, their Prawns with Cabbage concoction not enjoyable. On the other leg they had run out of the Fish option so no choice. Flights fairly punctual, aircraft in good shape. IFE has more quantity than quality, I find it very boring. Overall the flights were good, but that Prawn with Cabbage dish really should be dropped from the menu.",7,12th December 2016,Thailand
1205,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Bangkok via Hong Kong. Never again Emirates business class! We flew from Dubai to Hong Kong and a few days later to Bangkok. On all flights the staff service was really bad. Cabin crew busy inviting guys from economy to the bar and taking photos with them. During this time I was not able to order a drink at the bar - the bar seems to be more a playground for the crew than a place for first and business class passengers. All aircrafts were in a bad shape and dirty. Dinner Service was not able to let me dine with my Partner together on both flights. Qatar Airways is much better!,5,7th December 2016,Germany
1206,✅ Verified Review | Boston to Hyderabad via Dubai. Emirates used to be good but standards have fallen. 13 hour flight from Boston to Dubai and the entertainment system did not work all the way and a few other passengers had the same issue. Pre-ordered vegetarian food was not served and they came up with an excuse that they are running short. Quantity and quality of the food has decreased. Need to do lot of work to regain the old standards.,3,7th December 2016,India
1207,✅ Verified Review |  Prague to Dubai. I managed to get the bulkhead row 52 which had a lot of leg room. Service was flawless and the meals were superior those normally served in economy class. IFE was excellent and wifi was very useful. We landed before schedule in spite of circling above due to Dubai Airport congestion.,6,3rd December 2016,United Arab Emirates
1208,"✅ Verified Review |  Melbourne to Lahore return via Dubai.  All sectors operated by Boeing 777-300ER. Check in Melbourne was good. Lahore was chaotic. Lounges in MEL and DXB the usual EK lounges. However the contract lounge used by EK in LHE needs to be reviewed. CIP Lounge is dirty, damp, corrupt staff, stale food etc. LHE-DXB sector was operated by a dated Boeing 777-300ER. Rest of the sectors were ok. Cabin crew on board were a hit and missed and lacked consistency in quality. Food on board was very bad. Cabin Crew and Food has been on a downward spiral out of control over the years and there does not seem to be any appetite from management to improve service. This being said, flights were reasonably close to time and IFE was not bad. Emirates is slipping and it has become obvious.",5,2nd December 2016,Australia
1209,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Maldives via Dubai. Emirates was highly recommended to us but all I can say is it was a big disappointment and we are dreading our return flight with them. Positives - polite staff, seats comfortable. Negatives - service and amenities. Husband not able to use IFE controls as it had jammed. We ordered two courses as suggested on the menu booklet for a light eater. Waited one and half hours after first course for cheese (we ordered with our starter as we did not want the main course) - told that it had all gone as they had served everyone else in the cabin, even those behind us. After showing our displeasure, they did make up for this by getting us some cheese and offering good wine from first class. Why not offer this in first place rather than telling us the cheese had gone? On a long flight that arrives at night (2am), we wanted to sleep - not an amenity bag in sight. I asked for one and was told they only supply on night flights. Well I'm sorry but when I board and arrive somewhere early in the morning then I expect an amenity bag. That is night time and that is when you require those bits and pieces that add a little (paid for) luxury to the start of a hard earned holiday. Having paid thousands for business I do not expect an airline to be so stingy - they should supply amenity bags regardless of time of flying. People do need to wash and clean teeth and freshen up during any long haul flight. This is appalling cost cutting meanness and sorry I thought my thousands in air fare bought me a small bag of comfort. I have flown business with other airlines and received much better service. I was so excited to fly with Emirates as I heard good reports, but they will not be my first choice again really not good value for money. Felt there was no balance between profit and service what they needed to do was so little but the impact would have been so positive. Very sad.",2,29th November 2016,United Kingdom
1210,"London Gatwick to Dubai with Emirates for a family holiday. New aircraft. The best part was flying is the Emirates style. They offered activities to my kid. The T.V, plugs and so on are well positioned. It evan had a coat hook. The food was very nice. The seat was very good. The ground staff was very good. One disadvantage was that I was sitting at the back. But it was our fault because we did not check in online.",4,26th November 2016,United Kingdom
1211,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Mauritius return via Dubai. We have flown round the world with various airlines, but this was the first time with Emirates. It was so comfortable, the in-seat entertainment the best we have seen and the staff, both in the air and on the ground, were helpful. We spent twenty eight hours on four flights and the staff did everything they could to make us comfortable. The check in staff were friendly and the process swift and easy. Their uniforms are smart and professional. Boarding was simple and, because there were three gangways, one to upstairs, it was quick. The A380 is quiet. The food was very good. The lighting onboard was perfect. During night hours it's a dark gently blue ceiling with twinkling stars. At dawn, it is exactly that. The entertainment system. Three external camera views and one little oddity that I found a complete Godsend. On the music section, I found a sleep hypnosis track by Anna Rowe. My mistake was putting it on ""repeat"" because some way into it, I had gone. But then when it started again, it woke me up! The seats were comfortable and a good non-intrusive recline. The usual cushion, blanket, headphones etc. If you bring your own headphones/noise cancellers etc, make sure enough bring the double-plug airline adaptor with you because their headphone sockets are dual-plug. You can use your mobile, get data and charge devices. The plane has its own mobile service for you to connect to, watch out though, it's not cheap, so best to go on airline mode in case your phone auto-cones and someone rings you from home.  We always choose either side of an aisle, not far from the loos. Economy class, at the front, there are four loos, which is very good. and they were very clean.",9,26th November 2016,United Kingdom
1212,"✅ Verified Review |  Delhi to Sao Paulo via Dubai. From the chauffeur pick-up and drop to boarding, the experience was very smooth. The cabin was lit with mood lighting and both long haul aircraft had the StarLight, unique to Emirates, a feature I find amazing - to lie down and look at stars while you fly! Cabin crew service differed on the long hauls, inconsistency is the name of the game for cabin service in Emirates. The crew from Rio to Dubai could not do enough for you while the attendant on the Dubai to Sao Paulo leg was asking passengers to lift out the tables for dining! The seat itself is comfortable in a lie-flat position but has terribly limited storage. The IFE is fantastic. What Emirates misses is the dine-on-demand on ultra long hauls and pyjamas. The amenity kits by Bvglari and clean, well stocked washrooms were very welcome. WiFi on board was available on both long hauls. What I love on Emirates is their food but it was disappointing on the flight from Rio due to probably a lack of catering's understanding of an Asian Vegetarian Meal. The transit in Dubai gives you access to the trimmings in the Business Class Lounge along with a Moet and Chandon Bar, shower facilities, healthy cuisine etc. All in all, a very glamorous, luxurious experience and will recommend.",5,25th November 2016,India
1213,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Doha. Discounted economy travel at its best. On time, great aircraft, terminal and staff great. 5 star service at a one star price.

1214,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Dubai. . A full business class cabin but a very pleasant and enjoyable flight from Emirates. The aircraft was new and had the latest version of ice digital widescreen with a mind boggling selection of films and TV shows. On this morning departure from Manchester we were served continental breakfast and then lunch. Food was plentiful and delicious. The guinea fowl main was particularly good. Not something often served on an plane. With 42 passengers in business the crew were kept busy but were friendly and no request was too much trouble. Washrooms were kept clean, and stocked with cologne, toothbrushes, shaving kits etc. We landed on time, immigration and baggage delivery were fast and I was in the limo within 30 minutes of landing. The only slight negative was that they ran out of one of the red wines, Cloudy Bay Pinot Noir, which was understandably popular.",1,21st November 2016,United Arab Emirates
1215,✅ Verified Review | Rome to Bangkok via Dubai. A wonderful journey with Emirates. The ground staff try their best for passengers. The seat was large for economy and the space felt good.

1216,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Dubai. Had heard great things about the airline and my wife and I were looking forward to the flight/holiday. What a disappointment. The headphone jack was not working, the recline button on my seat was not working. The seat itself was not completely fixed. It kept slipping.  When the food arrived, my main course looked like it had been opened and it wasn't even hot. Some passengers could not have their first choice meal. When we landed in Dubai, we had to be bussed to the terminal. The return flight was worse. Seating in the middle of the middle row (seats E/F) is definitely a mistake. The cabin staff seemed oblivious to us. They kept missing us when the drinks were being offered. (we only wanted a cup of tea!). They even forgot to ask us for their headphones and blankets at the end of the flight. There was hardly anytime between the main meal and snacks. We found one or two of the cabin staff who served us rather unprofessional.  All in all, a pretty disappointing experience.  The A380 is an excellent aeroplane and hats off to the pilot and his crew but I feel that the cabin staff could not handle the number of passengers it can carry. Will only use this airline if I really have too. We had a wonderful holiday in Dubai but the return flight left a bad taste in the mouth.

1217,✅ Verified Review | New York JFK to Guangzhou via Dubai with Emirates. Where is the service heading? Does their management know? The AVML food on this route specially from JFK is horrible. Staff are becoming lazy and so talkative amongst themselves rather than focussing on the service. Water bottles are so small you have to keep asking for water and then an attitude is shown to you by the staff. I know this is a growing airline but if the growth is not controlled it will be a downfall for them soon.,7,15th November 2016,United States
1218,"✅ Verified Review |  
Flew Emirates from Melbourne to Auckland. Seat 23K on upper deck of the A380 rear cabin. This leg was upgraded to Business by invitation, thus I was not eligible to access the lounge, which was fine. Upon boarding, ground crew saw my Boarding Pass and allowed me to enter the waiting area, which led to early boarding, that was quite nice. The cabin was almost empty to the point I was the only seating passenger at the rear. Crew members were all overly friendly and took their turns to greet me individually by remembering my surname - I never felt so spoiled. One flight attendant even handed me an amenity kit, which was not complementary for such a short hop across the Tasman. Bar service was exceptional as well, I was invited to have a drink and talk to the crew members, who are not shy at smiling towards the passengers and being professional at the same time. Breakfast was tasty, signature sweets were particularly delicious. I consumed two bottles of drink from the mini bar, and it was replenished in-flight. WiFi was slow and hard to use. The cabin flown was not fitted with the airlines' brand new products, edges and corners have started showing some tiny wear and tear - this was the only drawback that I am able to think of. The crew members deserve the highest praise, I felt that they walked the extra mile to maintain a conversation with me, just like being with friends. I am looking forward to flying with them again sometimes in the near future.",1,14th November 2016,Australia
1219,"Glasgow to Bangkok return via Dubai. Check in good in all airports. I'm Skywards Silver, so boarding is good. All flights pretty much on time but arrival in DXB and having to bus from a remote stand to the terminal is nonsense. As usual variable standards from the cabin crew - infrequent drinks runs and disorganised meal service resulting in myself and another passenger, not even being offered a meal - it's not exactly very complicated, and the flight was only half full. Emirates are well priced and reliable and I make use of the lounge in Dubai but the service in the cabin is average at best and too often pretty poor. Emirates were better a few years ago but standards have not increased as fast as their route network.",4,13th November 2016,United Kingdom

1221,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Dubai return on the new 2 class A380. The plane is basically a flying cattle market and it is obvious that Emirates are moving towards to a pile 'em high, sell 'em cheap service, except that it's not so cheap. The service from cabin crew was virtually non-existent apart from serving the meal and collecting headsets/blankets at the end of the flights. Call bells were left unanswered throughout both flights with passengers resorting to self service to get a drink. No drinks runs other than with the meal. Seat pitch and width has also been reduced downstairs compared to the 3 class A380 (no doubt to cram more seats in). Emirates service has noticeably deteriorated over the last 12 months. I used to sing the praises of EK, but not any more. Will be flying with Qatar Airways next time.",5,12th November 2016,United Kingdom
1222,"✅ Verified Review |  As part of a Sydney-Singapore-London-Sydney trip, flew with Emirates on a Qantas ticket. EK335 from Singapore to Dubai and then connecting to EK7 to London. The aircraft's are in impeccable shape and the usual, low, levels of noise with the A380. Comfortable flight in both cases. It has been noted that the FA quality can be variable. On these two flights the FA's were pretty good and attentive. One with Emirates is that they have their FA's clean up the cabins. That means collecting rubbish, blankets, headphones, whatever is not tied down. It bugs me as I just do not think it is a good look for the airline to have their staff act as cleaners and rubbish collectors. That is the job of the ground crew and its messy to look at with bags of blankets walking up and down the aisles. The IFE is less good than you think. Movie selection is great when you have many hundreds but not when they are mostly foreign language. The English selection is poorly made up and could not find many or any I really wanted to see. Overall a solid experience with EK",3,11th November 2016,Australia
1223,"✅ Verified Review |  London Gatwick to Dubai return. The Emirates A380 is huge, quiet and with a brilliant in-flight entertainment system, only let down by the headphones. So my advice is but a two pin adaptor and wear your owns to get the full benefit. But that's where it ends. On both the outbound and return legs, the inflight service was terrible. Slow to the point of lazy, a choice of menu that's undeliverable by the time they've reached the middle of the flight, staff who offer little by the way of a solution when asked what's possible and disinterested in passenger comfort. I had to wait 40 minutes for a meal to be offered to me after I asked for a different main course to what was available in the trolley, and then it was the same meal I had declined. I asked to speak to the cabin manager twice, who finally arrived 10 mins later to apologize. On the return flight, the experience was much the same. No choice of menu for over half the passengers, two hours into flight before offered a drink and my meal arrived 50 minutes (!) after my wife's vegetarian ""choice"" was offered to her. This was labelled Vegan which isn't what was ordered and then another 10 minutes debate occurred with the cabin crew who said that there was nothing else available unless she wanted to wait until the end of service to see what was ""left"". When I was finally presented with the remaining meal choice (chicken with olive sauce) I had to ask for a drink, and the steward said the drinks trolley was on its way - it was half the length of the plane away! Somehow other passengers were given drinks with their meals, but we at the ""back"" were treated as an after thought. The passengers behind us had exactly the same experience. A note of advice for Emirates. Olives are a divisive ingredient, people either like or dislike olives so if you include a meal with olives, more people will avoid it than choose it! Leaving you short of choice! The overhead luggage cabin had crew luggage which they proceeded to access a number of times during the flight - constantly bumping my head as they reached up. On one occasion, the stewardess walked off and left it open for 10 minutes before coming back to close it. So my overriding impression of the airline is that it needs to improve quality of service on a human level. It's all very well having the latest aeroplane but if passenger experience is based on what's on tv, and food and drink service is a secondary concern, I for one won't fly with them again.

1224,"✅ Verified Review | Arriving in to Delhi from Kuala Lumpur, I was in the transit zone to catch my flight the next morning with Emirates with a final destination to Lisbon. I had no checked luggage and warned Emirates prior leaving (early that morning) of my arrival in order to allow for a smooth transfer and me to check-in at the hotel in Delhi Terminal 3. I have previously done this with multiple airlines without any issues. AirAsia, a budget airline, ensured that I would be brought to the transit area and confirmed twice (additionally to my early confirmation) with Emirates staff in Delhi that I would be arriving. Upon getting to the transit zone (escorted by AirAsia staff), I was told that Emirates staff should be there and that they would assist me. It took 30 minutes for someone to show up. Needing a ticket to pass the security in the transit area, the Emirates staff had to go and print it outside; so I was told. I was expecting this to be already printed upon my arrival as everyone was warned. This not being that case, I was told that it could be arranged in 15 minutes. It took a total of 6hrs during which I was told constantly every hour that it will be another 15 minutes by Emirates staff. I couldn't sleep all night and obviously didn't get to the hotel in terminal 3. On top of this, no upgrade was available on the flight to allow me to get a bed when when I was promised by staff that I could do this at the gate counter. Some staff were completely incompetent by either constantly pointing at other individuals saying that they couldn't help me or giving wrong information. Overall, I can say that this has been by far the most unpleasant experience I have had with an airline which ruined the first 2 days of my 1 week holiday in Portugal. I simply cannot comprehend this lack of professionalism from a company like Emirates.",10,3rd November 2016,United States
1225,New York JFK to Doha with Emirates. I've come to love the service provided by this airline. Very affordable tickets to begin with as I was flying in the off season. Efficient check in process. Awesome inflight amenities. Food has been a very pleasant experience. I love the A380. It is spacious and quiet. Love the lighting. Crew are attentive and professional. Inflight entertainment is the best in the business and quite clear as to why that is. I really don't have anything negative to say about this airline. Efficient in its timings as always. I will always consider this airline whenever possible. I just wish that they would start flying to Philadelphia.,8,2nd November 2016,United States
1226,"✅ Verified Review | Kuala Lumpur to Frankfurt via Dubai with Emirates. This perhaps is my worst flight experience ever. My flight and seat was booked and confirmed 3 months in advance. When arriving back at Dubai airport for my Dubai - Frankfurt flight EK045, they informed me that the flight was over booked and refused me check-in despite arriving more than 2 hours before departure because I did not do online check-in. Apparently my seat has been allocated to another passenger. They offered me the next available flight and free ticket but I refused as I was traveling with my colleagues and had to be in Frankfurt for a meeting. The customer service said that I have to wait until check in is closed to see whether is there any available seat. After waiting until almost boarding time, they finally allocated me a seat and ask me to rush to the gate. Onboard, I checked in my coat and went to the allocated the seat 65C which is right next to the lavatory. Throughout the entire 6.5 hour journey, it was just horrible. I'm entirely fine with me with people going in and out of the toilet. But every half and hour or so, someone and somehow loss their sense direction and came knocking into me. Just before landing, I press the assistance button to retrieve my coat. Nobody answered. Upon landing, I immediately walked up to a stewardess asking for my coat and she said I had to wait until all the passengers leave so that they can bring it up from the back of the plane. I mean, this returning of the coats or whatever should be done naturally before the plane lands and need not to be instructed. Obviously I was the last to board the plane and the last to leave the plane in this flight. To me, this is unacceptable for a world class airline they claimed to be. Even a budget airlines has better service than the Emirates.",9,2nd November 2016,Malaysia

Business as usual, very positive reception on the aircraft, hand luggage was stored away, crosscheck and takeoff. Then Emirates showed their way of customer care once again. First beverage service 90 minutes after take-off together with dinner - actually not a meal but disgusting. After lights were turned off part of the crew was gathering in the service-station directly behind row 51 to loudly exchange their experiences on Mauritius while slamming some compartment doors. Passenger complaints did not bother them at all. Any cabin sevice was discontinued. Even on request. I never ever was confronted with such a rude cabin crew behaviour - Fly Emirates does not mean Enjoy Emirates.",9,2nd November 2016,Germany
1228,"✅ Verified Review |  In short: Unprofessional and rude cabin service, awful meals, dirty cabin, and most annoying is that the cabin crew just don't seem to care about anything. I'm a frequent traveler (usually every other week on CX or MY) I only choose Emirates since the kids wanted to travel on an A380 from Bangkok to Hong Kong. We had seats 52H/J/K next to the galley, to say passengers may find the noise from the galley troublesome is a huge understatement. Firstly, the galley is brightly lit and lights shine directly on you, they don't use a curtain. Even if you block the light with a mask you have the noise, lots of noise, if it's not the constant banging of the galley cupboard doors it's the cabin crew talking. Meals were low grade and poor quality. Meal service took forever and was completely unorganized, my special meal arrived and then was promptly removed never to return. 50 minutes later I was offered a regular meal. Condensation from the galley freezers made the floor soaking wet in front of and below our seats - the crew explained this always happens and covered the area in blankets. ICE system is good, but the headphones are a perfect example of form over function - who has square ears? EK385, was met at BKK airport with stairs on the tarmac about 20 minutes after landing, and free bus ride to the terminal. Even LCCs like AirAsia afford their passengers an air bridge to walk into the terminal.

I made a complaint to the purser, she apologised and they served another one. During the dessert, they served ice cream, but for myself and my wife there was no spoon. We ended up with the tea stirrer. Furthermore, I saw a flight attendant queuing for the toilets in front of me, and refusing to assist passengers.

Such a delay is not my first experience with Emirates. Staff onboard were just okay except one - the rest of them all seemed stressed out.

I was excited to fly on Emirates and try out their new amenities in the Business cabin including the bar and space to move around. However on the day of the journey I find out that instead of the A380 the aircraft was now a Boeing 777-300ER. A much smaller plane. Instead of the spacious and luxurious Business cabin they had changed our seats - it was now 2-3-2 with some of the business seats having no direct aisle access. I was in the window seat so was stuck trying to get to the aisle on both legs of my journey. The seats seemed a bit worn out, the IFE control a bit heavy and clunky and it was not a lie-flat seat, which on such a long journey is a huge problem. I hated the trip and felt completely let down. If they had not indicated that this was going to be a A380 I would never have flown with them and given them my money. Emirates then did an about face when I contacted them via email saying its well within their rights to change equipment and not inform passengers!

1233,"✅ Verified Review |  The flight from Bangkok to Dubai was very smooth and easy. First time enter the aircraft it was too warm in cabin, no AC I guess, when you sit on your seat you must turn on your own cooler. It happened also when I continue from Dubai to Paris. The cabin crew was friendly and they are busy so take time if you request something. The food is not special, the toilet is clean. And when 30 minutes before landing the cabin crew will take your blanket and headset, and that make me uncomfortable, I think they shouldn't do that. And for seat in economy it was very good and comfortable.",9,29th October 2016,Indonesia
1234,"✅ Verified Review |  Cape Town to Dubai. The timing of the meals on this 9-hour overnight flight was senseless. Firstly, it took them 3 hours to serve supper, by which time I'd lost interest and gone to sleep. Then, they woke me up 3.5 hours before landing for breakfast, which I also declined because of poor timing. So, there was only a two-hour window when the cabin didn't smell like a restaurant.",1,27th October 2016,United Kingdom

1237,"✅ Verified Review |  London to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was our first flight with Emirates and we had high expectations . Although our seats had been booked prior to arrival at the airport we were advised to change them by the check in clerk who said we would have four seats between two of us in one particular row. This was not so. Although we passed one man who was stretched out across several seats to himself, the two other seats in our new row were occupied by the largest lady on the aircraft plus her hand luggage. It happened to be my birthday on the day that we flew and I must say it spoiled my birthday somewhat. When we flew two days later from Dubai to Johannesburg, boarding staff asked how my birthday had gone, I replied that since she had brought it up it had been spoiled by the events during the previous flight. I was then told to request a particular row on this flight where we could have better seats as some way of recompense. When we boarded the plane once again, we were let down and the seats were not available. I tweeted and complained formally to Emirates about this. It actually took them 32 days to reply and that was after prompting and more tweeting. Many tweets and private messages on Twitter were actually ignored. When we eventually received a response it was disappointing and did not even refer to the fact that one passenger had four seats to himself. I have never come across such poor customer service to be frank. We certainly would never fly with Emirates again. ",2,24th October 2016,United Kingdom
1238,"✅ Verified Review |  Lisbon to Bangkok return via Dubai. First Leg of the flight happy that was on time out of Lisbon, early on Dubai short connection so it was good, the flight crew was fantastic on that leg. Second leg from Dubai to Bangkok I must say that I am starting to hate the A380-800 - many people not sufficient capacity from the crew, imagine get a meal and only 45 minutes later something to drink. Second part of the journey Bangkok to Dubai with a flight coming from Hong Kong seats assigned could you imagine all dirty, made me sit on them until other place was free, it was really dirty, in the end after some complaint got me a place on the rear of the plane - at least the plane was half full so could stretch a little and sleep all the way. Final leg to Lisbon on my favorite Boeing 777 because it has a fantastic last three rows with 2 places and lots of space. I have travelled a lot by Emirates but somehow the difference to others is not that much right now, going to try Qatar Airways the next trip. Not happy, the service has gone down.",10,23rd October 2016,Portugal
1239,"✅ Verified Review |  I have been flying with Emirates for business and leisure for over 10 years and have only flown Economy class where I have found the service to be of excellent standards. Recently I was offered the option to upgrade to business class and I decided to pay the additional premium. The service I received during my flight was disappointing, and quite substandard. Dubai to Manchester the journey began really well. After 15 minutes into the flight my TV and all electrical equipment failed to work which meant I couldn't not watch TV, close the blinds or switch off the overhead light. I made the cabin staff aware of this and was advised that she would reset the TV and this would resolve the issue. One hour had passed and none of the faults had been fixed. On my way to the toilets, I raised the concern once again and was advised that the reset would be done again and that it should resolve the issue. I sat patiently waiting throughout the meal service without any form of entertainment. I then decided to lay back my seat and get some rest and was constantly annoyed by the overhead light which I could not turn off. 2 hours had passed and a second cabin staff came by asking me to leave my seat so she could reset the electrical switches which were located under my seat. This was done twice without any positive result. The service I received in business class became anything but relaxing. Almost 3.5 hours into the flight and half way through my journey I was offered the chance to move to another seat which I found unacceptable and a little too late in the day. I emailed the customer affairs department and they offered me 25,000 air miles which amount to nothing. I cannot even get an upgrade! Really disappointed with Emirates and the way they have dealt with this. I do not recommend flying Emirates Business class, really not worth the extra money you pay. If you have an issue on the flight don't count on dealing with their complaints team after as they wont offer you anything, try and get what you want while your on the flight.",2,22nd October 2016,United Kingdom
1240,"✅ Verified Review |  I had a disappointing flight in business class from Washington to Dubai, flight service was 1 out of 10. From beginning of flight, the attendants ignored me, they even haven't gave me complimentary welcome package before take off and just passed me like they don't see me - I complained to them and they said they have no more left! At Dubai airport after waiting 30 min for my luggage, i became to know that they left my luggage in Washington Dulles airport. So i send them email asking for refunds and after a month on 22/09/2016 they sent me an email says they will not refund but they will top-up my mile account with 20000 miles as a gesture of goodwill.

1241,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Hong Kong and very disappointing. I have been flying Qatar for many years and this is the first time to fly Emirates. The planes are badly designed with drab colors and no atmosphere. The food was bad and staff just okay. The whole experience was worse than Air Asia, but the price was very good - 20% less than Air Asia. So we will be using Emirates again but will take our own food.

Meal on board was poor. Cleanliness could be better. The seats are rather uncomfortable in the economy class.,1,20th October 2016,Poland
1243,✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to London Heathrow. Check in was quick and nowadays there seems to be a lot of issues regarding carrying Samsung 7 phones and staff are extremely strict and vigilant about this matter. The plane was parked in a different area and you had to climb the stairs to access the upper deck. The seats were the usual A380 ones which I really like. We took off promptly and landed ahead of time. A light meal was served after take off although almost everyone went to sleep. Breakfast was given before landing. staff were efficient and extremely pleasant. I asked for some tablets for headache and they quickly got some green tea along with chocolate bars along with it! Overall a very good flight.,4,20th October 2016,United Arab Emirates
1244,✅ Verified Review |  This is a convenient flight which leaves around 11 am and gets into Dubai at 8 am the next day. Check in was swift and boarding took place efficiently and on time. The flight departed around 45 minutes later than schedule. Seats of A380 on EK are always one of my favorite ones although this aircraft showed a lot of wear and tear. Service was very good and the crew attended all the passengers on this full flight very efficiently. Two main meals were served and there were smaller snacks that could be taken anytime. IFE remains as one of the best and inflight wifi is dirt cheap at 1$ for 500mb. We landed on time and bags were out in a jiffy.,2,20th October 2016,United Arab Emirates
1245,✅ Verified Review |  Washington to Dubai. I arrived early at Dulles airport and the counters opened only 3 hours before departure so I had to wait. Check in was swift and we could use premier lanes for security which can be of great help when its busy. The plane was very full in all 3 classes. Crew were extremely nice and the flight was a comfortable 12 hour journey. The seats are one of the best with lots of space and storage available. Emirates is the best airline for IFE and also for the fact that you can purchase on board wifi at only 1 USD for 500 mb!!,1,19th October 2016,United Arab Emirates
1246,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew Bangalore to San Francisco in Buiness class. The Bangalore - Dubai segment was on a B777, and the business class was all right, the configuration is 2-3-2 and not all seats have direct aisle access, but this was only a short flight (4 hours). The flight from DXB to SFO on an A380 was fantastic with staggered seating in cabin, excellent cabin service and food. The bar on the A380 is a huge plus as it's a nice way to unwind and socialize with fellow travelers on a long flight. The chauffeur service provided by Emirates for business and first class customers is amazing. Also the best IFE that I have seen. There is free wifi on board upto 10MB however it is very patchy and I didn't have connectivity for the most part.",8,19th October 2016,United States
1247,"✅ Verified Review |  Guangzhou to London via Dubai. The best thing about Emirates is their cabin crew who are excellent. The worst thing is their business class seats which are appalling on their older A380's. To get into the seat is very tight unless you are a fashion model, if you are anything but a model then the tray that pulls out for eating is just crazy - I would need to lose at least 3 stone to be able to use it. It will not go past my tummy and what pregnant women would do is just beyond me. On the later A380's they have changed this tray realising that their first effort was hopeless and very badly designed. However their is very little space in this business class seat and I was very disappointed. Travelling often on business to the Far East this has to be the worst seat I have ever sat in. The food is OK but not being able to put it in front of you is frustrating. The crew know all about this problem as they told me they often get complaints. Add all this to the extra long flight by travelling via Dubai and I will be going back to good old Far East airlines who fly direct.",1,18th October 2016,United Kingdom

Booking, check-in, lounges, seat comfort, drinks, IFE, on-board WiFi, chauffeur service to / from the airport are all top-notch. Only item were Emirates have ample room for improvement is on-board catering, where Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines are much better, but I do not fly to eat well, would always prefer a better seat and IFE above better food on ultra-long haul.",10,16th October 2016,Belgium

Emirates A380s compared to European airlines A380 aircrafts are a totally different experience: cabin nice and bright, seating comfortable with nice seat pitch and amazing inflight entertainment. My Asian vegetarian meal was excellent. A staff member from another part of the cabin served my meal. She spoke Slovenian and this was such a nice gesture. The whole cabin crew nice and professional. I hope that they will add more transatlantic routs from Europe.

1251,"Gatwick to Durban via Dubai. My first time on Emirates, the A380 is a great plane to travel being spacious and quiet - I felt less fatigued than normal I think its spaciousness may be a factor - plenty of toilets and comfortable seats. The Boeing 777 300 is a good plane and looked quite new although the seats didnt seem quite as wide as on the A380. The service was good and I thought the food and drink service above average. The cabin crew were efficient. We arrived on time, the travel experience was very good.",6,14th October 2016,United Kingdom
1252,"✅ Verified Review |  I flew with Emirates from Brisbane to London return via Dubai. The staff were sour, acting like my asking for a glass of water were a hassle, and the food was disgusting. But the flight over was nothing compared to the return journey. After not being notified that my flight was delayed due to a plane crash at Dubai airport (ever heard of email, Emirates?), I arrived at the airport to start my journey home and finally found someone to guide me to a customer service desk, where I was told of the delay and given a hotel and bus voucher. The customer service agent also told me that the next leg of my flight would be organised when I was in the air - someone would meet me at the gate (I scoffed at that one). Trying to get on the bus was like surviving a round of the hunger games, after an hour I gave up and caught a cab. After spending 14 hours in the hotel I thought I would be winging my way home. After finally arriving in Dubai, there was no one there to meet me at the gate so I proceeded to the transfer desk, where I was told by someone who had just been served that the queue wait time was 7 hours. So after waiting for 3 hours I found staff who told me that if my online booking had been updated with my next flight, then I shouldn't bother waiting in the queue as they weren't giving out hotel or meal vouchers.  I checked online and found that I had indeed been put on a flight - scheduled to leave in 24 hours time. I settled in to spend 28 hours total in Dubai airport with the other people laying on pieces of cardboard and crates.  On my return to Australia, Emirates refused any compensation for breaching their contract by not providing any accommodation or meal vouchers and now ""considered the matter closed"", refusing to respond to any further emails. So if you're looking to fly Emirates - beware! They may show you great service (which is a bit hit and miss anyway), but when things go wrong, they are unorganised and have no care for the people they serve or the inconvenience they cause.",1,14th October 2016,Australia
1253,"✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to Amman return via Dubai. As a manager of a national football team travelling with a group of 29 and excess team luggage, it is important to check everyone through and verify the number of items and be able to cater to the oversize luggage such as physio tables and medical supplies. The ground staff on the Emirates counter at Auckland Airport when we were starting our journey were superb. They were very efficient, helpful and able to provide exit row seating for our three passengers who were 6 foot and over. They went above and beyond in their customer service, which made the start of our very long journey a pleasant one. The lady that we dealt with and it would be an absolute delight to be served by her again.

It was a full flight and the attendants did an excellent job and you could see they enjoyed their work.

Smooth check in, open 3 hours before; Emirates owns its lounge in Bangkok which enhances Emirates experience, is not the most beautiful lounge but the catering is remarkably good and diverse. Boarding to the plane through separated bridges, ambiance of the cabin is nice, resembling the first suites, seats are not super big but the atmosphere, gadgets and decoration put Emirates on the top. Lot of business class seats, midday route, lunch offered, this time was ok most of the time is great. Entertaitment system is rich in variety, films, music, etc, wi fi.

1256,"Having travelled Emirates first class in the past and loving the experience I really looked forward to my business class flight with them from Singapore to Melbourne. The seat/bed is spacious, stylish and comfortable. The selection of beverages and food average and the service on this flight, appalling. The staff made flying business feel like the new economy. They do not make eye contact, answer the call bell, return with requests (even if you ask four times at twenty minute intervals) or serve you breakfast if you ask not to be woken for it (regardless of your slumber status). They do: congregate in the guest onboard bar/lounge talking loudly in a manner that could lead you to believe they were having their own cocktail party.",9,9th October 2016,Australia
1257,"Durban to Brussels via Dubai was the first time I travelled with Emirates. My first impression was that the cabin is really spacious, the seat felt comfortable.  I noticed that you have a bit more space for your legs than with some airlines, which made the flight a lot more comfortable. I was amazed by their IFE - so many movies, games, etc. I didn't use the WiFi.  The flight attendants were really friendly and I enjoyed the fact that they have a crew on board that can speak so many languages. The food was also very good. One thing I thought was a bit annoying that you only have that big assortment of movies on the longest flights, so I could watch many more movies from Durban to Dubai than from Dubai to Brussels. But overall I had a very pleasant flight with Emirates.",9,8th October 2016,Belgium
1258,"✅ Verified Review |  Glasgow to Melbourne via Dubai with Emirates. On the GLA-DXB sector, the Boeing 777-300ER was just 11 months old, clean, tidy and with impressive IFE. We had chosen the back of the plane where the window seats are in twos and would recommend this for couples; it felt spacious and comfortable. The 3-4-3 layout of the rest of the economy cabin did look very cramped however. These seats at the back put you close to the toilets but did not find it to be an issue, however you are at the back of the queue for meals which meant I was lucky to get my choice (FA had to go and find me a chicken tandoori). The long Dubai to Melbourne sector had us in seats A and B of the 3-4-3 economy layout; this felt much more cramped and uncomfortable, and will avoid in future. The A380 was slightly older, with the older style of IFE which was not altogether functional; my partner's screen was buggy and only one headphone worked. There was not much staff could do about this except change her seat which would have meant splitting us up. The A380 had WiFi but it was so slow as to be practically unusable for anything more than sending WhatsApp messages. Food on both flights was excellent, both for me (normal diet) and my partner (vegetarian-lacto-ovo). The crew made a few soft drinks runs but could have been more frequent, particularly on the longer sector. There are complimentary beverages on Emirates but the crew seemed so busy you didn't feel welcome to order one outside the meal runs. The crew were mainly pleasant but could have been a bit more welcoming and enthusiastic, as I said above you didn't really feel overly welcome or waited upon (it's not their main job but it's nice to be looked after). Check-in staff at Glasgow were helpful, pleasant and efficient, but we were caught unawares by the strict (weighed at check-in) 7kg carry-on limit. Unfortunately our biggest issue was with some damage to my partner's case which meant that it could no longer be rolled and will need to be repaired/replaced. Emirates were initially helpful, sending me a form to fill out and asking for photos etc, but 3 weeks later we have heard nothing. In this respect Dubai-based customer service needs to improve.",8,7th October 2016,United Kingdom
1259,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to New York JFK. This is our first time traveling in business class on an A380-800, when we first booked our tickets we specifically requested special assistance for my husband who is in the wheelchair and unable to stand. When we arrived at the check-in counter, we asked for confirmation that special assistant would be provided at the gate to help my husband board the aircraft using an isle chair. An hour before boarding we asked the agent on duty if they had all the necessary preparation that we had asked for. In all 3 instances we were assured that everything was under control. So we relax, believing that everything was under control. However when it came time to board we were forced to wait at the aircraft door until all passenger had been boarded because no preparation had been made to assist my husband into the aircraft. At this point the flight crew apologized to us for the confusion and inconvenience. After another 20 mins waiting we accessed the business class section on the upper deck using hilift truck (typically use for catering) from which we boarded the aircraft and were moved to our seat location. Unfortunately there were no moveable armrest on any of the business class seats that would enable a wheelchair bound passenger to transfer from the isle chair to the seat without risking injury. Fortunately my husband is strong enough to transfer over the arm rest without falling down or injuring himself (perhaps they are no fully accessible first or business class seats on Emirates), everything else from that point on until we disembarked was excellent! The aircrew were truly professional and made every effort to accommodate us. Hopefully our next trip with Emirates would be better experience. The weak link as always is the ground staff.

This as a concept works for a couple or single passenger but if your a elderly or a family this is a disaster. I just had to pay 120 euro for a normal seat in 44A/C, no extra leg room etc just to ensure my parents over 73 had a seat together. Emirates,  greed over service.

Unfortunately, the cushion and blanket are small, tatty and hardly comforting or warm. There was no drinks service until after the main meal was served. The selection of beverages was lacking and the quality of drinks seemed cheap. It was, however, the meal service that really stood out as a real disappointment.  On this route we were to 'enjoy' two hot meals. I have included photos as I don't think I could adequately describe how bad these meals were in words alone. The best part of the whole meal service was looking around the cabin and seeing the faces of fellow passengers do the big unveil on their hot meals. Priceless! Luckily Emirates do provide cheese and crackers and chocolate to partly make up for the rest of the meal. The crew service was professional and generally friendly, but I feel like the crew are trying so hard to get the service right that they fail to engage with passengers. They appear unnatural and don't let their personalities shine through. The flight boarded quickly, took off on time and landed into Perth only a few minutes behind schedule.

During this period of long-waiting time, Emirates didn't make up anything for us. There was no meal voucher, no nothing. I won't rate its service as good as its reputation. It is pretty poor actually. Secondly, during my whole itinerary, I had to take shuttle for at least 4 times. It was either from flight to terminal, or from terminal to flight. It's definitely not a pleasant experience because my wife and I had to wait in a jammed, hot bus, and the transit time was long. I travel average 8-10 times a year and fly various airlines worldwide.

No one even bothered to ask whether we need anything for the baby - when I asked a crew member I need to make formula for the baby she asked me to wait till the service over, that is for another half an hour. Can a baby wait like an adult. I wanted to wash her milk bottle and she asked me to go to the washroom. No helping hand at all. Luckily I had my parents with me to help.

The crew on the Sao Paulo to Dubai leg were fabulous - very warm and attentive. On ultra long haul flights, the seats seem to recline a lot more on a lie-flat arrangement. Hot towels, Bvglari amenity kits, very soft and warm blankets and well stocked washrooms await onboard on these ultra long haul flights. Some of the cabins had the StarLight belongs only to Emirates - bringing a great mood in flight. Emirates, while being a great airline, has inconsistent cabin service onboard which is surprising. The ICE entertainment system was spectacular - the best in the skies. What I give it to Emirates for is their food and it's quality - marvelous! There are 3 meals on the 14 hour leg - in addition to main meals, there is a light bite service. Due to the lack of on demand dining, they have snacks in the galley in between for the hungry.

Although the flight was really long 14 hours I enjoyed it, entertainment system is still one of the best, the food and beverages are awesome. Only complain for this flight is that the headphones are a bit cheap but I guess for the money I paid for this trip they are ok. ",7,22nd September 2016,Bolivia

Food was very bad - breakfast to Dubai was not even substantial, neither egg nor any piece of meat was served, just two types of bread, cheese and fruit cocktail. Service from Manila to Barcelona and Barcelona to Dubai was bad. No attendants doing the rounds to offer water or juice when meal service was long over. This was only done for the flight from Dubai to Manila. Meal was served very late - going 2 hours into the flight. Fancy packaging for some biscuits with cheese and salsa and tiny toasted bread but actually everything in that nice packaging does not taste good unless you are too hungry. Cod fish served over noodles was not fresh.  The salads served were awful, and i'm not picky with food. This is the first time that I ever asked for noodles during any flight just because I ate so little on my tray. Very disappointed indeed.",7,22nd September 2016,Philippines

I highly recommend Emirates.

For Taipei, they use the China Airlines lounge in Terminal 1. It is interesting that in AMS they give you a choice of lounge use or a restaurant voucher. My biggest gripes were that the meal service seems to be really drawn out. Also, business class bags took a long time to come out in Taipei. Wifi was barely usable-not really worth USD 1.",10,21st September 2016,Taiwan

We reached the Dubai Airport and purchased some Duty free and was little late to the boarding gate, but somehow managed to be there before 10 minutes. To our surprise at boarding both our tickets have been upgraded to Business Class. My first ever Business Class Experience. Loved the whole journey to Bangkok.

1276,"✅ Verified Review |  Johannesburg to New York JFK via Dubai. There was a total of 7 of us travelling on 2 separate bookings (6 people on 1 booking, 1 on another). Our flights home beginning on August 3, 2016 had us travelling with British Airways, Emirates and JetBlue Airways. We had no issues with our flights on British Airways and Jet Blue. Our luck ran out upon dealing with Emirates for our return flight home. I called Emirates August 2, 2016 (24 hours prior to our flight) to request kids meals and a vegan meal for 3 of our passengers. While on the phone with the representative, I inquired on our current seating arrangements to ensure the children would be sitting with the adults in our party. When I provided the booking number for my husband, I was advised his ticket was cancelled. You can imagine my shock upon hearing this. I asked the representative why it was cancelled, who cancelled it and when. I was advised it was cancelled July 24 – 1 day after we started travelling – and 6 months after booking the flight. The representative advised Emirates cancelled the ticket as they saw 2 tickets for a Brett Hale. My son’s name is BH Jr and my husband is BH. There is no space to enter a suffix within the Travelocity website. However, it is noted that one ticket was a child’s ticket and one was for an adult. In addition, I had to input the date of birth for each traveler.I never once received a phone call or email from Emirates to confirm I did in fact book a duplicate ticket. And I did not receive a refund for the cost of a ticket that they cancelled. After the representative informed me that Emirates made the error in cancelling my husband’s booking, I requested his ticket to be reinstated as it was, so we would all be travelling together. I was told that the second leg was full and that wasn’t an option. While informing the representative that that was not acceptable and that Emirates needed to find a way to ensure my husband was travelling with us, I was told he would send an email on an “Urgent Basis” and someone would be in touch with me. At this point, it is 7pm and the first leg of our flight home (via British Airways) is at 8am. I had been on the phone with him for over an hour. We were in a game reserve in the middle of South Africa and my cell phone did not have service. He advised I could try calling back in an hour. Long story short, it took over 4 hours and multiple phone calls to multiple people to get his ticket reinstated. Even then, I was not confident he would be flying home with us. I was extremely dissatisfied with the level of customer service and how they handle their own errors.",10,19th September 2016,United States
1277,"✅ Verified Review |  Mauritius to Dubai. Our problems began with the meal service. We waited nearly half an hour from first to main course, but it was when the main course arrived that things really went downhill. The menu promised ""Braised beef brisket served in a rich jus with mashed potatoes and turned root vegetables"". What was served up with a barely warm meal with a dried up chunk of meat minus any jus. Judge for yourself from the photo. When I drew the attention of one of the cabin crew to this, she apologised and said she would find out what had gone wrong and come back to me. 20 minutes went by with no one coming back, so I pressed the call button, which was completely ignored (this in itself is worrying as it may have been an urgent matter that needed crew attention). I finally collared the purser as he was passing, got another apology and an explanation that all the beef meals were minus the sauce and offer of the same again but heated up. When I declined, explained that my partner and I were allergic to fish ruling that alternative out and didn't like curry, the other alternative, he said he would go away and see what else he could come up with. Five minutes later and the offer was beneath contempt - the purser brought the fish and curry meals I'd already rejected and two other dried up meals from economy. He then, very reluctantly said he'd see if there was anything else available from first class and claimed that they had the same meals so there was nothing he could do. I decided to pass and go the the sweet course (15 minutes waiting for that) while my partner decided not to eat at all. For the remainder of the flight, the cabin crew did their best to ignore us, or when they had to interact, their manner was off hand to say the least. Customer focus was lacking completely. The purser came past later and apologised but sincerity was lacking completely. About 30 minutes from landing, my partner pressed the call button to request the return of his jacket which had been hung up. Again, the call button was ignored completely. This was the worst flight I have had. By contrast, the connecting flight from Dubai to Manchester had an outstanding cabin crew and provided a superb flight experience. However, this is not the first time I've found a lack of consistency with Emirates, but it will be the last time. I will never fly with them again and I would recommend others to choose another airline.",6,19th September 2016,United Kingdom
1278,"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates has lost it's edge with series of unnecessary changes over the last few years. If traveling to first world destinations, Emirates provide their latest aircraft, with state of the art features and polished services. However, take a flight to a not so developed destination and you are better off flying one of the budget airlines in the sector as there isn't much difference between the services and a whole lot to gain in the price. Flying to London heathrow on their A380 you would expect the best and unfortunately it failed to impress.  Had previously enjoyed Emirates design and layout of the A380 but having flown recently, it seems they've tried to save up on costs with reduced spacing between seats with thinner cushions.  Emirates staffs feel more likes nannies than polished butlers. Although they speak more than a dozen languages and look fashionably tailored, that's where it ends. An economy return ticket from Dubai to London was priced at a whopping 1200 GBP when other airlines were much cheaper. The only advantage I saw in paying so much was that it was a direct flight and I didn't have any lengthy layovers.  One would expect that after having checked in online a baggage drop would be quite a simple task and hardly time consuming. However, it seemed like the baggage drop lines were bigger than regular Check in queues and I don't really find much of a differences in what the staff were doing in the check in counters and baggage drop counters. Overall, I am quite disappointed with Emirates and next time I fly this sector, I might seriously consider other airlines.",2,19th September 2016,United Arab Emirates

Good leg room on this plane and the video on demand is excellent although screen significantly more responsive on the newer and larger product on both the DXB to/from BKK legs. Long 6 hour layover on return but meal voucher provided for basic yet adequate fayre. The exit music is irritating and becomes headache inducing very quickly; it does not provide me any euphoria. Would always fly Emirates from Jeddah as they consistently deliver. Staff 10/10 on all legs but a little overworked on the final DXB to JED sector.

1280,"✅ Verified Review | Milan to New York and Rome to Bangkok via Dubai. I've been flying with Emirates for the last 3 years during holidays. I have flown several times both in Economy and Business Class. I have flown in Business Class both on the Airbus A380-800 and the Boeing 777-300ER. Business Class is way better on the A380-800, where you get a lot of privacy (specially in windows seats), great food and a great service. Business Class is good enough in the 777-300ER, but you don't get a lot of privacy and the seats are angled lie-flat, so not as comfortable. Emirates Economy Class, specially on board of the A380-800, is one of the best in the world. I have flown for years with Lufthansa in Economy Class, and Emirates beats it hands down. The PTV screens are huge, there is a good amount of space, the plane is really quiet, and the service is better than on Lufthansa. What I mostly liked about Economy Class, apart from the IFE is the fact that they don't bring your food in hot aluminium trays, but in hard plastic, that is much better looking. In Economy Class, you also have the possibility to see the menu and they pass with drinks many many times.",9,18th September 2016,Italy
1281,"For my first flight on Emirates, it was fabulous. Even though the flight left at 2.40am (which meant we had to sit around in Melbourne Airport for 7 hours, as we arrived from Wellington), the crew made it bearable. They were attentive, friendly and helpful. The flight was operated by a newish 777-300ER (A6-ENG) which was great. The ICE system was faultless, which on top of the generous size of the screens made the flight fly by. The seat size is a problem however, the 3-4-3 configuration is just mean. But the foot room was better than any other economy class. The food on-board was very average for Economy, as a small snack was provided after take-off and then before landing a large Breakfast was served. I also really liked the fact that the crew handed out hot towels and face wipes before takeoff and before landing. An added bonus was the great (but understandably slow) Wi-Fi, a first for me on a plane.

1286,"✅ Verified Review |  Upgraded to First private suites on Brussels to Dubai using 777-300ER. A very agreable flight of course, but with a long series of problems that should not occur. After take-off, the seat could only operated through the large TV touch screen, not through the remotes, which is a bit painful as the creen is about 1m from the seat. This was fixed after 15 min. Then the TV screen started going black for 30sec every 10min while the soundtrack of the movie still played. The system was reset and then worked fine. Although only 3 people travelling in the First class cabin, crew brought a wrong entree, and insisted it was the right one even it was obviously not the case. After 10 min they apologized, and offered to cook the right one but this took another 30 min. Halfway through the flight the seat completely jammed, but I could easily pick another one as the cabin was less than half full. I must say Emirates' first class seat is in fact worse than their lie flat business class seats on the A380s. Upon arrival in Dubai, I used Emirates chauffeur service, was assigned one of their cars but the driver told me he didn't know the (Meydan) hotel and asked whether I could guide him. Which I could not, so I asked for another car and driver, and left the car. But the organizers of the service on the pavement insisted I wait until they explained the route to follow to the driver. I did not want to wait at midnight with 36C temperature outside, and only after insisting really hard did they call another driver.

My seat did not recline. Passenger sitting next to me had to move as that seat would not recline either. Toilets were dirty and had no water in the basin to wash hands. Cabin crew very slow in serving any foods/drinks. It took over three hours before any drinks or food was served after departure. Headphones did not work properly.

I waited over 15 minutes to use a toilet in business and then one of the hostesses came out with her makeup bag (there was a line for both toilets). Service so slow and they act like they are doing you a favour. I asked for a red wine and got a cup of tea! When I mentioned this I still did not get the red. Two Sauvignon blancs is not smart for a choice of white wines. On board ICE entertainment system clumsy.

Service In Flight: The first time in my experience of flying business class that I was not greeted with a welcome drink, while other people in the cabin received it. I had a feeling of unwelcomeness from the staff - an overall indifference.  The only thing premium is the menu and not necessarily the service. I think the diversity of their crew is the biggest problem. There is no cohesive identity and embedded culture of service and welcoming.  Even having to press the call button twice on a few occasions to receive service. Food quality varied - some were delicious, the others not. Seating was very uncomfortable.

Also past few trips on Emirates they always have shortfall of water bottles even after 3 hours of take off and their food choices have gone so commercial and reminds me of cheap United Airlines food - specially the light bite and they should stop serving this uncooked doughy pizza.

1293,"✅ Verified Review | Birmingham to Colombo via Dubai with Emirates. Poor throughout, specially onboard food and service which is what I thought Emirates was renowned for and worth paying extra for. Birmingham to Dubai we had the A380 which was very comfortable with seats that I could sit cross-legged on. The entertaintment system was also amazing. This is where the positives end as the boarding of this flight took so long that there was an hour delay to take off. The organisation for transfers was poor to non-existent with a massive queue for security at Dubai with minimal time for the connection. For the rest of our flights, Dubai to Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka to Dubai with a stop at Male and Dubai to Birmingham, we had the smaller and older aircraft B777-300. This was noticably older, dated and uncomfortably cramped. The entertainment screens poor quality in comparison. The worst of all was the inflight service. Pressed my buzzer for help with a non-functioning screen and an hour later, nobody had come to ask what I needed. In the end, I had to keep pressing the buzzer continuously about 15 times before someone came to us. I had no entertainment for the duration of 2.5 hours. It only took 5 minutes to fix when they actually got round to it. The food and beverage service also poor. They had a choice of fish or chicken but by the time they got to aisle 23, they had completely run out of chicken. I offered to wait till the end of service to see if any was left. I was told categorically there was none left and then later I saw them handing chicken to some passengers. On the 8-hour flight from Dubai to Birmingham, after an hour on the plane before take off and an hour on the bus waiting to board the plane, apart from the little tub of water with the snack and breakfast, no drinks runs to even offer people water.

Comfort of the bed was OK, a little more padding would be nice. They provide you with a mattress and blanket, which helps. Seat 14K has direct window access with storage against the wall which was great. Boarding directly from the lounge at Malpensa was really nice, I love the inflight bar in the back. The food was good, not great, I've had just as good food on domestic USA first class, although not as plentiful as I received on Emirates. A couple of glitches. The FA's completely forgot to serve me my main course, I had to ask after everyone was served. Very apologetic and kind apology from the FA. Next I wasn't served my dessert, I was dozing, that was OK. However I was offered a choice of desserts and the wrong one was brought to me. I expected a little more polish.

The Emirates ground staff kept Business and First class passengers queuing at the boarding gate for some time while some ""priority"" economy passengers boarded - I have never seen this before. Even when allowed to board the problem was that economy passengers had to come through the Business Class cabin, so stowing hand luggage etc. became a problem as to do so meant blocking the aisles while these passengers were trying to get past. The aircraft had a very tired feel and look. The seat layout in the Business Class cabin was 2-3-2 which made leaving your seat if you were not on the aisle a problem. The cabin staff were good and efficient. The food was possibly the worst I have ever had on any Business Class flight. Although there was supposedly Wi-Fi available I was never able to connect to it.

There are a range of big brand duty-free shops at T3 so that was a bonus. Then boarding came. In my personal opinion, Emirates should have extra boarding time for bigger planes like the A380s as the long line resulted in a delay of 1 hour. After boarding, I checked out our seats. The seats are comfortable with adequate leg-room. The IFE System was clearly bigger and better than the last time we flew with Emirates. The flight was smooth as usual with EK and the meal was very delicious with now more bigger portions. We safely landed at Dubai International Airport at Terminal 3. It was very hard, though to find out where flight connections were as two signs led to different places. The shops at Dubai were even better with more choices of retail. Soon after the short wait we boarded the Boeing 777-300ER from Dubai to Dhaka, in Bangladesh. The seating was mostly the same but had smaller IFE Systems like old Emirates and the touchscreen response was poorly. They managed to maintain the plane cleanliness quite well. The food was more than shocking on this one. Nevertheless we had another smooth flight to Dhaka. On both flights the cabin crew were outstanding and were kind and polite.

The car arrived at our Singapore lodgings in fine time, and we were soon on our way to Changi, where we arrived in time for a very fine breakfast in the First/Business Lounge. We were welcomed aboard our 777, with the usual courtesy, but my infotainment screen wouldn't work. Attempts to re-boot failed. Fortunately there were empty seats with working screens so I moved. All went well until the pilot announced we were about to commence our descent into Dubai. I switched to the 'flight details' on the screen of my 'new' seat. Without warning the 'destination' changed from 'Dubai' to 'Sharjah'. Ten minutes later the pilot announced that we would indeed be going to 'Sharjah', and another ten minutes later we indeed landed at Sharjah. Our 777 'parked' alongside several others, in a secluded corner of the airport. Hours passed. We weren't allowed to leave the plane. Information was hard to come by from the crew, but someone with contacts in Dubai learned on his mobile phone that there had been a serious incident at Dubai which closed the airport. Without warning buses arrived, and we were asked to board them. It looked like the bus depot rejects had been mobilised. We found ourselves in a minibus which had definitely seen better days. It did have air con but I made the mistake of sitting in the front over the engine, which gave out more heat than the air con gave cool. We set out, we knew not for where, in a convoy with police escort. After many stops and starts, we eventually arrived at what appeared to be the 'employees' entrance of Dubai airport. A man in white robes and a baseball cap then appeared to assume responsibility for our 'convoy'. With much gesticulating he seemed to instruct the drivers of the buses in our convoy to follow him. He drove an ordinary saloon car, with a yellow flashing light on top through a security gate, and our convoy of barely street legal buses followed him 'airside'. Eventually, driving by parked planes, and other 'airside' traffic, we came to an 'arrival gate', we were only too pleased to leave the oven-hot interior of the mini bus for the air conditioned splendour of the main terminal building at Dubai. Imagine our delight when we saw that the 15.00 hrs departure for Glasgow had not yet left. It was now about 19.30hrs. The 'departures screen' announced 'Gate Open', so we made our way there and checked in. The Emirates staff in attendance couldn't tell us when the delayed flight might actually depart, but they did advise that we should stand by. Eventually the flight was boarded, and took off at about 21.30hrs. Six and a half hours late. The flight was incident free, although again I couldn't make the 'infotainment' system work, and we landed at Glasgow at 01.45hrs on Thursday 4th August 2016, just under six hours behind schedule. Our bags of course were still in the Middle East, so carrying practically nothing we went to get our chauffeur car home. The final indignity. They had given 'our' car to someone in greater need, we would have to make do with a complimentary local taxi. So ever so jet lagged, a taxi, nearly as grotty as the Sharjah mini bus, but not so hot, delivered us home in the wee small hours of the morning. Actually less than six hours behind schedule was so much better than I feared when we first diverted to Sharjah. We were reunited with our luggage during the evening of Friday 5th August, when a driver brought them to our home. A journey memorable for all the wrong reasons.",7,9th August 2016,United Kingdom
1304,"✅ Verified Review |  We chose Emirates to fly Manila to Boston and then back to Manila from JFK International. Our flight to Boston was pretty good, except that my seat and my cousin's seat cannot be reclined, so we weren't able to sleep well, it was very uncomfortable. I think they should do something about it knowing that long haul flights are very tiring. Now, our flight back from JFK int'l airport to Manila, is very much a hassle . We were only told that the flight was delayed for 5 hours exactly during check in time (instead of 11:20am, it became 4:30 in the afternoon) which obviously made us upset plus the fact that nobody is explaining why it was delayed. It's a good thing though that they already allowed us to check in our luggage. However we needed to line up at the Check-in counter for an hour and 30 minutes. It was also disappointing that when waiting on the line, almost all the counters prioritized the Business class passengers. The flight however had a late boarding, it was supposed to board at 3:30 but they started boarding at 4:30. Our co-passengers have become impatient. We all crowded the boarding gate. Why? No one announced what's happening. I asked the ground personnel, what time are they boarding but her answer is just ""in a few minutes"". What the heck, you let us wait for 5 hours and more and you cannot tell us specific answers. And now we have to wait for 12 hours for our flight to Manila. We're supposed to be back to work by tomorrow. Please give fair treatment to all your passengers. The reason for delays must be explained. ",10,8th August 2016,Philippines
1305,"✅ Verified Review | Dubai to Auckland via Melbourne with Emirates. Sat in window seat 19J (aisle), my husband in sat in window seat behind that was more private. Very pleasant and efficient crew who served meals fast. Emirates did not have any women's amenity kits onboard, so I received a men's one. Some of the passengers in middle rows had seats that were malfunctioning and would not recline, I felt very sorry for them, at the start of a 14.5 hour flight when you've paid a lot of extra dollars for a lie flat seat, that isn't very good. Our previous flight which was shorter had the same issues with seats. Business class was full on this flight, so no way to move seats. Seats are comfy enough with the mattress topper but a little on the short side for me. Much room is devoted to the minibar at the side of your seat, I would rather have a wider seat, the drinks are not chilled either, so I just got chilled drinks / water from the bar. Good selection of movies and TV shows etc. The bar was fabulous, I woke up early (3am) and had a coffee. Could not fault the attentive and very helpful staff, any problems were due to lack of maintenance of seats and ground crew not loading amenity kits.",7,8th August 2016,New Zealand
1306,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Amsterdam - Dubai - Dar es Salaam with Emirates. In Amsterdam our flight was already delayed 3.5 hrs which left us 30 minutes to make our transfer in Dubai. Upon arrival in Dubai, we could not disembark for another 15-20 minutes. After running through Dubai airport we arrived at our gate to be the last passengers boarding to Dar Es Salaam. Hungry and thirsty we entered the plane. The personnel aboard seemed very reluctant and after calling the stewardess to ask for some water they just did not come. Having travelled for 22 hours, all Emirates served us were 2 meals and a couple of drinks, but the worst was yet to come. Upon arrival to Dar Es Salaam, the luggage was lost. It's 4 days later and still we have not heard anything from them.",2,8th August 2016,Netherlands
1307,"✅ Verified Review | This was my third trip with Emirates from London to Bangkok via Dubai, and first in Business, having been fortunate to fly in first on the previous two trips. Emirates is still one of the few airlines to offer a courtesy chauffeur service at selected airports, this is a huge cost saving and always appreciated. The moment you board the plane, you get the feeling that your custom is valued, that every effort will be made to make your journey as comfortable and enjoyable as possible. The seats are spacious and luxurious. The choice of beverages superb, the bar at the back of the cabin an excellent escape, and great opportunity to socialise with other passengers and cabin crew. The dining option was a decent choice, and as good as you'd expect if you were dining out. Travelling on an airline like Emirates is always the perfect way to bookend a trip, and I look forward to future travels with them.",7,7th August 2016,United Kingdom
1308,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Dubai with Emirates. Having just got off the flight from hell, I feel a few words are in order. There were real problems and long lines boarding the A380 in Manchester and this was not well handled. The food when we got it was cold and a 7 hour flight only provided one meal? The paying passengers seemed to be a inconvenience to the cabin staff - very slow and poor service and they never smiled or interacted. You press the call bell and wait and wait and wait. Then get out of your seat and go and find them. This is not the sort of service I expected and if this had of been my first flight with them I would never have used them again. I have been flying with them and other airlines for 20 years. I shall be using them in the future as I have never had a problem like this before but would not again fly in a A380 from Manchester.",10,7th August 2016,United Kingdom
1309,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Brisbane via Dubai. Appalling service from Emirates. I had my business class flight cancelled and resold whilst I was on my connecting flight. I was only informed of this seconds before boarding despite being checked in. I was told I would have to fly the following day as I sat with a leg injury in a wheelchair! I asked if any first class seats were available as I cannot bend my knee. I was told both business and first class were full. This was not the case, after arguing my case with a member of airport staff, I was given a business class seat and it's occupant was bumped up to first class! I cannot believe I was lied to and that given that Emirates had sold my ticket to someone else they did not just offer me the first class seat. Instead leaving me upset and distressed in the airport. Since then they have lost my luggage. $6,900 was paid for my flights. Emirates, what are you playing at?",9,7th August 2016,Australia
1310,"Stockholm to Manila with Emirates. Not baby friendly. Flew with Emirates twice this year. One return flight to Singapore in Jan and next was return flight to Manila in Jun. On both flights, service not too good. Although we reserved a bassinet in advance, we still had to request it inflight. Irritating policy on serving food. Travelling alone so I requested that they serve my food later as my baby was asleep on my lap but they declined due to policy. Suggested to put my food tray on the floor which is ridiculous. Other airlines like SQ are more flexible on such requests. No food served for babies even if you ask. Lastly, difficult to get help when asking assistance with my baby's milk. I had to carry my baby and go all the way to the pantry to get someone to assist me.",5,7th August 2016,Sweden
1311,"✅ Verified Review | Mumbai to Amsterdam via Dubai with Emirates. Aircraft very clean but the service was poor. The flight attendants were extremely lethargic and did not seem interested in serving the passengers. I would say it's a complete avoid airline. Even the food is not upto the mark. Most it was cold, hot meal wasn't hot.",2,7th August 2016,India
1312,"✅ Verified Review |  Perth to Dubai. I booked my ticket through Qantas for a route serviced by Emirates. At the check in, Emirates staff was not able to locate me in their system. Instead of clearing the issue with Qantas themselves, I had to go and talk to Qantas and forward Qantas message to Emirates, because according to Emirates (expressed in pretty arrogant way) I booked the ticket with Qantas and thus it is up to me to clear it. For me as a customer it does not make sense, as I would expect the airline to clear the issues they have with their internal systems themselves and not make the customer to try and resolve it at the airport, a couple of hours before the departure. Once the issue was resolved, the seat I originally booked, was also changed (from aisle to the window). Of course it is a small thing, but in the circumstances, it was annoying, as I particularly booked a seat at the aisle feeling unwell before the trip.",10,6th August 2016,Australia
1313,"Jeddah to Bangkok via Dubai. Both sectors on time; service excellent on both routes; both planes clean; both planes good food, drinks incl alcohol (DXB to BKK only). IFE both planes excellent. My only issue was that the cabin crew did not want me to film in the aeroplane for some weird reason; fair enough but perhaps she could learn to ask in a more respectable way. I would always fly Emirates; they really are excellent.",5,5th August 2016,Saudi Arabia
1314,"✅ Verified Review |  Gatwick to Kolkata via Dubai, with a stopover of around 1 hr 30 mins in Dubai. Mobile boarding pass for both legs issued at the time of on line check in. Only reaching Gatwick at the time of depositing my check-in luggage I was told due to bad weather at Dubai, the incoming flight was delayed, consequently the flight from Gatwick will be delayed by 1 hour, meaning I will not be able to travel on my scheduled flight from Dubai to Kolkata - but have been rebooked on the next flight departing Dubai more than 12 hours later. There were at least 1 flight from Gatwick, and 2 flights from Heathrow that departed earlier than the 13:35 flight I was travelling, and if I was put on any of these flight I could have comfortably connected to my original DXB-Kolkata flight. Despite 1 hour delay in LGW-DXB flight, there was still 30 mins before my original DXB-CCU flight was due to depart, and I offered to travel on my original flight with my hand luggage only – the checked in luggage can arrive in a later flight, and I can return to the Kolkata airport to collect my checked in luggage. I was only told everything is being done as per Airlines policies. (One of the ground staff started choreographing what fog looks like and why it is difficult for a pilot to fly through fog). Flight EK016 arrived in DXB around 1:25am, but I had to ask 4 different airline staff before gaining an understanding that I need to contact the transfer desk. It took me 17 mins in the queue at the transfer desk before I could reach the front, by which time the connecting Kolkata flight (departinf 02:00 hrs) was gone. I even proposed that I be allowed to travel to any other city e.g. Mumbai or Delhi, and be given a ticket on any domestic airlines from Mumbai/Delhi to Kolkata (or cash instead), but was told this was not possible. My only option is to travel by the later flight departing around 12 hrs later. So I had to hang around for the next 12 hours at the Dubai airport. My London to Gatwick flight was protected by EU Regulations, but the connecting flight from Dubai to Kolkata was not, despite travelling on the same ticket so I could not claim compensation under EU Regulations. I understand the airlines has not anything legally wrong, but otherwise did not find any redeeming feature in Airlines handling of the issue, let alone appreciation of the inconvenience caused.",8,4th August 2016,United Kingdom
1315,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Tokyo Narita. During the flight, I wanted to buy some duty free products. I asked three times, and each time the cabin attendant told me that the person dealing with duty free goods would come along shortly, but never did. After the third attempt, I gave up. What annoyed me more was that the breakfast service was cancelled due to turbulence, after the special meals were already handed out during the same turbulence! I had recently experienced more severe turbulence over the Atlantic, and the in flight service was not cancelled on that occasion (different airline). So I had to look on enviously at some of my fellow passengers while my own stomach was grumbling. In the end, I arrived in Tokyo after a 9 hour flight extremely hungry and with a back ache (seats seemed to be made of cardboard). The only positive thing about the flight was the in flight entertainment, which included wifi and live tv. That, however, is not enough to convince me to fly on Emirates with my own money again, particularly as I paid a 25% premium to fly on Emirates this time. Very disappointed.",7,4th August 2016,Netherlands
1316,"Dublin to Manila via Dubai. As a frequent flyer on this route but typically with Etihad, I was booked with Emirates by a colleague who heard good things about the airline. Unfortunately this proved to not be my experience. When you fly long haul as often as I do the one thing that really matters is the seat - that's what I'm paying for. I don't believe I have experienced a more uncomfortable seat ever. Not flatbed but angled - no comfort in any position left me arriving with back pain and exhausted by lack of sleep. Unfortunately I get to enjoy it all again on the return trip in 10 days. The food was pretty awful also. Firmly back to Etihad for me and my team in future.",8,4th August 2016,Ireland
1317,"✅ Verified Review | London Heathrow to Cape Town via Dubai with Emirates. Check in at LHR seamless and agent very helpful in accommodating our maxed out baggage load. Straight to the LHR EK Lounge which was very well serviced and enjoyed very good pre-boarding dinner for what was the last evening departure to DXB. Boarding direct from lounge a real bonus with EK. A380 full as ever, but enjoyed a couple of hours at the bar before grabbing some good rest. Arrival at DXB gate delayed due to a ground issue, but crew kept us informed. DXB can prove a little tiresome as its so big. An hour in the lounge allowed a chance to grab some breakfast and a shower before boarding for CPT. Good seat in row 7 of the small front Business Cabin in 773ER. Enjoyed excellent service from the crew all the way down to CPT; great food, great wine, very good seat and IFE. On time arrival in CPT and bags quickly delivered to belt. For the fare, EK is hard to beat in Business Class.",1,4th August 2016,United Kingdom
1318,"✅ Verified Review |  Buenos Aires to Dubai via Rio de Janeiro. Perfect flight in Emirates First Class. This was a long flight, with a 3 hour leg to Rio, a transit stop and then a 14 hour haul from Rio to Dubai. I was the only passenger in First on the initial sector, and there were 2 of us on the second. Service was exemplary - warm, attentive and professional. The suite on the 777 is just as spacious as on the A380 and immaculately clean and shiny. As ever I enjoyed the mini bar, treat basket, beautiful amenity kit, writing set, and wonderfully soft pyjamas and slippers. I was able to get a great sleep. Food and beverage quality and quantity, as ever on Emirates, was First Class. Dom Perignon champagne, vintage fine wines, 40 year old port, ultra premium cognac. Wifi worked well and was available throughout the flight for just $1, not the rip-off charges on some competitors (Etihad and Qatar for example) We arrived early, luggage delivery was super fast and I was soon in my Mercedes limo and being whisked home. An outstanding flight experience and actually good value for money, considering the reasonable price paid. Highly recommended.",5,3rd August 2016,United Arab Emirates
1319,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Dubai in Business Class. An excellent experience from start to finish. Chauffeur drive pick up worked perfectly and check in was very quick. I was seated in my pre-booked aisle seat in the 777-300ER which serves the morning flight from Manchester (the other 2 flights are operated by an A380). Fast track security worked like a dream. Within 10 minutes of arriving at the airport I was seated in Emirates' excellent lounge enjoying an outstanding breakfast, as good as you will experience in the best 5 star hotels: cut fresh fruits, eggs benedict, stuffed field mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, warm bread and croissants. There were a selection of freshly squeezed juices and smoothies, but I opted for a glass of Veuve Cliquot champagne. Boarding was on time and we were soon seated with a friendly welcome and another glass of champagne. The business seat on the 777 is a little narrower than on the A380, but still very comfortable and it reclines to a lie flat bed, with nice new design duvet. Service throughout the flight was perfect with very good crew visibility and a purser who really was outstanding and lead by example. We enjoyed drinks and nuts (Emirates makes a very good Mojito), then a 5 course lunch, with light bites or afternoon tea served before landing. The inflight entertainment is of course very good, although unfortunately there was no WIFI or live TV on this 777. We arrived on time and were soon disembarked. I had collected my luggage, done some duty free shopping and was in my limo within 40 minutes of touch down. Outstanding business class experience in all aspects.",7,3rd August 2016,United Arab Emirates
1320,"✅ Verified Review |  Dubai to Manchester. Specifically chose this flight so that we could travel on the A380. Very disappointed. Boarding was OK and we were in seats 12E/F. Seats were a little narrow and widthways was restricted, nowhere to rest your elbows unless you used the bulkheads on either side, The floor ahead of the seat had a ridge in it which made it uncomfortable to stretch your legs out. Plane was 30 minutes late leaving due to one runway being out of use. Cabin service was very poor and disjointed. Starters were served and the mains did not arrive for twenty minutes. We were not offered tea or coffee after the meal and had to ask twice for it to be served, I gave up in the end. Times must be hard on Emirates; only one chocolate between us! The bar area at the rear of business cabin is the place to go if you want a drink, at least you get one there eventually. The pilot managed to make up the lost time and arrived in Manchester bang on time. Much prefer the A340 or Boeing 777 to this plane. We have the same trip booked later this year and I am wondering if I can change to another flight to avoid the A380.",4,1st August 2016,United Kingdom
1321,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Dubai. First time flying with Emirates for 10 years. Booked seats 11J/K which are the last row before economy section. Seats were a little bit hard, seemed to have little padding on the cushion. Legroom was OK but I could not get really comfortable in the seat. One major annoyance was the removable tablet on the seat frame which got in the way of my left arm and which restricted movement. The food service was good but the wine list is restricted when compared to Qatar Airways. The inflight entertainment was good but a bit fiddly to operate. Cabin crew were generally good and plane was clean and tidy. Overall a good flight but not as good as I was expecting.",9,1st August 2016,United Kingdom

1323,"✅ Verified Review |  Paris CDG to Cape Town return via Dubai.  Paris CDG - Dubai leg operated by an A380 and Dubai - Cape Town leg by Boeing 777-300ER; both airplane types were new, clean, and excellent overall. This was a very nice experience, cabin crew was friendly, and we had stars in the ceiling at night. Food was delicious and came in more than fair portion sizes, I think it reminded me of Turkish Airlines which provides very tasty and large portions of food as well. I was even offered a 12-year old single malt Scotch upon asking (I flew economy class). There are lots of movies to watch in a fairly big display, seats are comfortable and spacious, and some amenities are provided in the long haul legs (eg. toothbrush/toothpaste, night mask, and socks perhaps, I do not remember). They gave away hot towels pretty often, in the return leg from Dubai to Paris CDG they gave a hot towel 3 or 4 tiles, which was very welcome. I do not think I have ever had a better long-haul economy class experience. ",1,25th July 2016,France
1324,"✅ Verified Review |  Flying Emirates from Christchurch to Sydney in Business Class. EK operates a Boeing 777-300 on this route. The seat configuration in this aircraft is 2-3-2 which I personally think was quite strange since many airlines around the world have installed 1-2-1 arrangement in business class for large airplane types. The seats recline to almost 180 degree flat which are quite comfortable. The stewardesses were more hospitable compared to their male compatriot. When I asked for some more water to be filled up in my empty glass, he kept showing me the already provided bottle of water. Before landing all business class passengers were given express cards for being used at the immigration counters. All in all we were quite happy flying with Emirates.",5,24th July 2016,Indonesia
1325,"✅ Verified Review |  Good flight in general from Dubai to Bangkok, ultra-clean plane, nice toilet kit amenities, very attentive crew, plenty of movies, but no classical music. Food for such an airline miserable, with totally tasteless shrimps, and no fantasy in the menu at all. Seat not very comfortable: because of the removable screen controller, less space for elbow. Interesting also to note that all Emirates pictures show business class cabins in 2-2-2 configuration, never in 2-3-2.",3,24th July 2016,Thailand
1326,"✅ Verified Review |  Bangkok to Newcastle via Dubai with Emirates. This is business class on an industrial scale - literally. Onboard the service feels entirely scripted lacking any sense of personality or personalisation. The business class lounge in Dubai is akin to warehousing premium passengers - a cavernous space with no redeeming features. There was nothing good about this experience. And a queue of 10 for the rest room in a supposed premium lounge area? Really? This is not a premium experience, period. Thankfully I only to have to endure EK on a bi-annual basis. I'm so pleased to be able to reacquaint myself with ANA and Singapore Airlines as my regular flying partners.

1327,"✅ Verified Review |  Child Escorted service. I am so angry at Emirates. Paid for escorted service on London to Perth via Dubai route, that gives priority baggage only to have the luggage go astray. If this is how Emirates are with under 18's travelling alone and supposedly looked after, it makes you think what service you get for your payment. Now our little one has had to go shopping while very tired to get the basics. Come on Emirates, get into gear.",9,21st July 2016,United Kingdom
1328,"✅ Verified Review |  Manchester to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai. These were our first Emirates flights. Excellent cabin crew, friendly, attentive and happy to engage with the passengers. Both aircraft were very comfortable, but we prefer the extra smoothness and comfort of the A380. For a couple we recommend the central pair of seats which are positioned together with the mini bar section between the seats and the aisle. The wine selection was excellent and food very tasty and of a high standard. Regular supplies of hot towel throughout the two seven hour flights. The only negative was that I struggled to get the wifi set up, but that is probably down to my ineptitude. I could have requested help there but I didn't as I was into a film at that point. The Emirates lounge at Manchester was very good and is soon to be updated we were told. We were very impressed with the food in all the lounges we used, the KUL lounge was excellent too. There very good quality wines, coffee etc on offer in each lounge. Prior to these Emirates flights our most recent business class flights were from LHR terminal 5 and BA, Emirates offering is many levels higher than our experience there.

1329,"✅ Verified Review |  Emirates just won my worst airline experience. I was supposed to fly the simple Manila-Dubai-Washington route. But instead, I got Manila-Clark airport transfer via bus to get us on a plane there. We then were asked to wait without a clear departure time. Eventually, we left at 2AM after a 8 hour delay. Then they put me on a Dubai-London flight. When asked why this is the case, they tell me that I will fly to London and then wait for another transfer to get on Washington DC flight. Already exhausted finding our bags then moving the bags with us to a different airport and then waiting 8 hours, I told them I just want to wait for the next direct flight to Washington. They tell me I need to talk to the guys in Dubai for they can't do anything. But then upon checking, I find that I have an hour or so to move to the transit gate. At this time, I have no idea when I will arrive in London or Washington. I am now sitting at the Dubai airport to find out that I will have to wait another 4 hours in London. And they are announcing the flight to London need to be boarded. Since my luggage is already tagged through these stops, I am waiting at the gate. But I have to say this is horrible. More so since no Emirates representative is offering an explanation why these arrangements were made. Those that ticketed me in Clark airport in the Philippines was not even an Emirates staff.

1331,"✅ Verified Review |  Frankfurt to Mumbai via Dubai with Emirates. Very pleased with the journey, had a lot of leg space from FRA-DXB on the A380, felt like a lot of room for Economy. The Entertainment options were exceptional; I guess Emirates takes a lot of pride in this. I managed to watch local Indian TV interviews and I managed to catch a glimpse at my Nigerian neigbour who seemed to be watching something local too. So, a wide diversity and variety of IFE. I ordered a Vegetarian Oriental Meal which was just okay. I was expecting something more flavourful. I'd ordered the same on the DXB-BOM leg, but they chose to give me the standard vegetarian option (Paneer lababdar, I think) already available and I was thankful. Both very comfortable flights. The journey back to FRA was even more so. There was WiFi on the flight (so I could literally make a call over Whatsapp from my flight which somehow didn't work at the Mumbai airport). The Jain Meal (BOM-DXB) was excellent and the Asian Vegetarian Meal (DXB-FRA) was okay; I still have memory of the snack (muffin) they provided later - it was that good. I was impressed by how good Emirates is in terms of room space, food, staff, everything. Oh, the views for the morning flight from DXB-FRA over Iran, I think, were simply stunning - white, snow-capped mountains.",10,16th July 2016,Germany
1332,"✅ Verified Review |  Dublin to Brisbane via Dubai. I again travelled to Northern Queensland using Emirates / Qantas for a major family event. I left DUB on the late evening flight, supposed to leave at 22.25 but was delayed by 30mins or so because of an off load. Getting to the airport and similarly, on return, the chauffeur pick up worked extremely efficiently. Emirates is still, unfortunately, using the the DAA lounge in DUB. I had hoped, 2 years ago, that when they went to 2 flights per day, they would have their own lounge, like Etihad, but we can still hope. The DAA lounge is extremely basic, with no added frills. I flew in First with Emirates, DUB/DXB/BNE. Then transferring to Qantas Business for the Domestic connection to TSV. Out of DUB, it was very lumpy for the first 3 hours, to the degree that all the cabin crew had to be seated, so I didn't manage to get my evening meal until around 1.30am, by my clock. The 4 flights I had with Emirates in First Class, were all of a very good standard. Comfortable, good service and good food / wines.

We could not fault anything, as always we found the Emirates crew intuitive, respectful and courteous with nothing being too much trouble. The food, the choice of wine, the comfort of the seats, the ambience and the entertainment choices were first rate, and the chauffeur transfer home was the icing on the cake.

The soup and entree was nice but the main was probably left in the oven for longer time leaving the rice very hard and the the green beans a bit burnt. Apart from this down side, the entire experience was truly amazing.

Excellent food availability compared to other airlines I've traveled so far. Comfortable and spacious seats. Cons: There were long queues at the airport (airline could insist the airport authorities had more counters available), a little delay in take off timing and had an awful experience at transit airport (Male).

1337,"Difficult to fault, although I felt the cabin crew on the Delhi - Dubai (777-300ER) flight had an edge to them, attentive as soon as you board, called you by your name, introduce themselves and have a chat. Very welcoming. The upper deck of the A380 has so many cabin crew, they say hello as your go to your seat but then stand around for a long time before fully engaging, they seem to engage with each other more than the passengers. This is only an observation, but I have noticed it on a previous flight as well. Catering was very good from Delhi - Dubai, very good Indian meal, and Arab Mezze, lots of drinks offered and a beautiful Mango Mousse for desert. Cannot fault ICE the Emirates in flight entertainment system, its got an absolutely monster choice of movies / albums, more than enough, it took me ages to choose my movie as the selection was so good. Catering from Dubai to London, was OK, some sandwiches after take off which was early morning, were not particularly fresh, where as if you go back to the bar area the food there looked a lot more enticing (and fresh). I asked to borrow a pen, 5 times from the cabin crew to fill out my breakfast form, eventually had to go back to the bar to borrow one from the bar tender. Breakfast was good, and served just before landing at Gatwick. The A380 is a beautiful aircraft and just seems to float, little turbulence was felt, and the cabin / seats were superb. Strangely given the choice I would take the Boeing 777-300ER purely because the crew seem to be more on the ball, but overall the Emirates experience was very very good. Landing at Gatwick means quite a walk over the large bridge to get to the main terminal, assume due to the assigned parking areas for the A380. Bag was lost on arrival, no fault of Emirates, someone walked off with it by mistake, but Emirates were very helpful contacting the passenger who was on the M25 and had to bring my bag back - unbelievable.",9,12th July 2016,United Kingdom
1338,"Flew Copenhagen to Osaka via Dubai with Emirates. Very professional service on board, even when the cabin crew has to look after a fully booked plane.

1339,"✅ Verified Review |  Flew Emirates, Bangkok to Malta via Tunis. A tale of two contrasting legs: First leg Bangkok to Dubai fine on 777 or A380 depending on time of departure. New planes and the expected Emirates service/experience. 2nd leg from Dubai to Tunis left a lot to be desired - on a very tired, old 'workhorse' 777. Narrow width seats. Old generation ICE, no working power supply (at the time). 2hrs in Tunis - you are not allowed to disembark the aircraft and for the first hour are vigorously encouraged to remain in your seat while headcounts, security formalities are completed. Having just endured a 6-hr flight and probably a couple of hours in Dubai before the flight - and in need of a stretch, drink and to freshen up - it was frustrating not to receive better on-ground 'transit' care. Delayed outbound from DXB - TUN meant the flight took close to 20hrs all in all.",8,11th July 2016,Malta
1340,"✅ Verified Review |  Auckland to Brisbane with Emirates. A very comfortable journey. Boarding and departure were on time. The aircraft was clean and tidy and the cabin crew friendly and helpful. A delicious evening meal was served not long after our 5:10 pm departure and the trays were cleared away in a timely manner. The A380 is rock-steady in cruise and the quiet cabin is much-appreciated. The Emirates ICE entertainment system has a huge selection of movies, TV shows and music and kept us occupied for the remainder of the flight.",3,9th July 2016,New Zealand
1341,Sydney to Munich via Dubai with Emirates. EK continues to be our first choice of airline. The A380 is large and provides additional space and comfort. We fly Emirates to Europe through Dubai every year and they continue to perform to a high standard. The partnerships with Qantas suits us as we are frequent flyers of both airlines. Dubai airport is always busy and always interesting. It is easy to pass a couple of hours here.,2,9th July 2016,Australia
1342,"✅ Verified Review |  Paris CDG to Dubai with Emirates. Fantastic. The seat is excellent, staff are kind and caring. The big plus is an excellent choice of French wines with the meal. The meal itself was alright, nothing fancy. The only problem with Emirates it that they don't bring the food at the same time for people sitting together. We have in Europe a culture of eating together.

1343,"Flew Emirates from Singapore to Brisbane. Check in was great. Airport did a great job. While boarding, the flight attendants were friendly and approachable. However, during mid flight, they seemed rather tired and unmotivated. I was quite disappointed with the service as I expected more from them. During both meal services, the flight attendants pulled long faces, as if the passengers were a burden. Entertainment system was old, screen was small, selection of movies were poor. Seats were hard and cramped.",1,7th July 2016,Australia
1344,"✅ Verified Review |  First time flying with Emirates on flight of more than 10 hours. Plane was new, was excited to fly on an A380. Check-in in Dammam and in Toronto (going back) was very efficient. Inflight entertainment had the latest movies and entertainment selection was very good. Seat was comfortable (I'm a big guy). Food was OK, I ordered the seafood meal. Flight attendants were attentive to passengers needs. There were fruits, juices, chocolates, water at the back in between the meal service. The small pouch that contained the toothbrush etc was nice. Adequate number of restrooms, almost always no queue to use. Did not have to wait long for baggage in YYZ. My wife asked for a motion sickness pill on the YYZ to DXB leg of the trip (EK 242, YYZ-DXB, 13 Jun 2016). Flight attendant politely advised there was none on the plane and asked if another pill would do - gesture well appreciated. Wasn't able to use the wifi. Could do with adding more seating capacity at the gate in DXB, we had to stand while waiting to board.  Overall, good experience. Emirates never fails to impress. ",8,5th July 2016,Saudi Arabia
1345,"✅ Verified Review |  The flights from Frankfurt to Auckland via Dubai with Emirates was very comfortable. The seats in the economy class provide lots of space even for taller people like me. There were plenty of beverages to choose and all free. The food was quite tasty and enough to be filled. The most convincing feature at Emirates is the entertainment program on your touchscreen. There is a wide range of movies, TV shows and music in different languages. Even the latest movies are available. Although my flight took more than 20 hours it wasn't possible for me to get through the whole offering of entertainment. Nevertheless I got the impression that the cabin crew could be more present from time to time. Waiting time for service was sometimes too long.",9,29th June 2016,Germany
1346,"✅ Verified Review |  New York to Nairobi via Dubai with Emirates. We left on time - the flight was uneventful, the crew were helpful when you needed but responded quite slowly. The seat was comfortable and the plane was new so it had the new IFE - it was a rather fun flight. We arrived in Dubai on time and passed through security quickly for our connecting flight to Nairobi. The Nairobi bound flight was also good - the aircraft was new and we landed on time. I would recommend Emirates because their fares are reasonable and aircraft comfortable.

1347,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Denpasar via Dubai. We won't be choosing Emirates again. This was our first business class trip with Emirates rather than Qatar Airways, who we normally choose. A catalogue of problems, beginning with the chauffeur being an hour late to collect us, leaving us with a really stressful Friday afternoon journey around the M25 to cope with. We made it, but not by much. Seats on the A380 are great, but we were prevented from using toilets closest to us (reserved for 1st class we found out) and having to go to the back of the Business cabin to use an inadequate number of dirty toilets for what turns out to be a huge cabin. Food was mediocre; dried out (overheated) bread rolls and over-cooked dinners for both my husband and I. Staff are super though, that's their strength for sure. Arrived DXB, long bus ride to terminal (almost 15 minutes), very long walk and another change of terminals to find the next gate. Boeing 777 was really outdated; if you are not travelling with a partner, get ready for a stranger to climb over your not-very-flat bed to reach the aisle. Not acceptable in today's business class choices. TV screens are huge but the pixels make for grainy viewing and both my husband and I experienced our screens reverting to a puff-piece on Dubai and Emirates quite a few times when we were enjoying a movie. We could not connect to onboard wifi. Emirates lounge in DXB over-crowded with totally inadequate, smelly toilet facilities and queues at all times in both the men's and ladies loos. Emirates were cheaper than Qatar Airways but the choice for us will be to spend more to achieve the really high standard of care Qatar gets right. We still have out last leg to go to LHR and hoping for a meal which is not cooked to death and a taxi which shows up. Never again. ",10,16th June 2016,United Kingdom

Flew Kuala Lumpur to Dublin return. Flying with Emirates is a yearly affair now and they always meet my expectations. The ticket was value for money, hospitable cabin crew, flight journey largely smooth and most of all, always a positive experience.

1349,✅ Verified Review |  My first time flying Emirates Business on A380 from Dubai to Manchester. I was impressed from the start. Went up to the business lounge - lots of comfortable seating and delicious food and drink available. Went straight to airplane from lounge. My seat was at the back of the section. There was a male passenger in the seat over the aisle and I must admit I felt very exposed and too close to him. Luckily there were several empty seats so I moved to a window seat - this time seat over aisle was unoccupied. Seat was very easy to move and very comfortable. Later I was offered a mattress but didn't need it. Staff very pleasant and helpful although during the flight I did ask for a drink of hot water which I never received. Meal served on white cloth. China by Royal Doulton. It felt lovely to drink out of a porcelain mug. Food was ok - better than Economy of course. I was able to have my choice but I think I chose wrongly. Later I had afternoon tea - bread had dried out but fillings very pleasant - much better than economy's which are sometimes inedible. Nice big screen to watch. I visited the bar area which was fun. Lots of tasty morsels to try there as well as drinks. ,9,14th June 2016,United Kingdom

Typical Emirates business class, that is to say pretty much as good as you can get. The A380 from Perth to Dubai was a very early model and starting to show its age, but still everything was up to standard and sleep was easy. New Perth lounge does get a bit crowded when the A380 is leaving and lack of pyjamas on overnight flight a minor issue, but still would not fly with anyone else to Europe.",8,11th June 2016,Australia
1352,"✅ Verified Review |  Have flown Amsterdam to Dubai roundtrips with Emirates A380s since they started the route. Seat, IFE and overall cabin comfort remain top in class. Catering has recently improved, quality of the FAs is still erratic, but Emirates find it increasingly difficult to depart on time, both in AMS and DXB. When departure is delayed by more than 45min it is not possible to catch-up during the flight as the sector is not long enough. Turnaround time in Amsterdam is very short, and thus departure time suffers quickly when the inbound flight is delayed. Not sure why leaving Dubai on time is so difficult, but according to announcements made by cabin staff it is often due to passengers arriving late at the gate.",9,9th June 2016,Belgium
1353,"Flew London Heathrow to Dubai. Outstanding. Comments apply both ways. First time on an A380 and also first in Emirates business class. Normally fly with BA but for various reasons decided to give Emirates a go and very glad I did. Speedy check-in and straight into a very quiet and large lounge at LHR T3 with excellent food and beverage. Boarding straight from lounge onto top deck of A380. Had 3 aisle seats for the family, noticeable that Emirates have narrowed the aisle to allow for the wider seating arrangements. Very nice to have a near private seat and no neighbour, nice touch having the soft drink mini bar at each seat, and lots of good accessible storage. Seat took a little getting used to, I prefer being able to put my feet on the floor rather than on a foot rest and when lying flat out the shape of the seat in front encroaches where your legs go so means for taller people you have to adjust your position in the seat to be comfortable. The food was excellent, best I have had on board in 20 plus years and the crew were friendly and worked hard (I had slight concerns before flying as reputation is Emirates can be a bit hit and miss). Nice touch was the barman taking souvenir photos on request for passengers at the bar in an old style 60s technology Polaroid type camera - quite exciting for my daughter seeing a picture appear. And yes, being able to walk down to the bar makes for a good experience. Entertainment system and screen excellent. Phone can be used, wifi slow but ok for basic browsing. Large accessible toilets that were kept spotless for the entire flight. Fast tracked though immigration and priority luggage turned up first and escorted straight to the waiting limo. Overall this trip was on a different level to any I have had for many years, I will certainly now use Emirates as carrier of choice where possible if this is the normal standard.",6,7th June 2016,United Kingdom
1354,"Barcelona to Sydney via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 in economy is roomy enough but service was again found wanting after meal service. Dubai won't allow liquids of more than 100ml past the boarding gate area so you rely on being provided enough water inflight. This I found near impossible and with my annoying dry cough I needed the liquid. I tried repeatedly to hail a passing staff member only to be ignored. Never before have I pressed the assistance button but when a staff member finally responded it was with an impatient look but she eventually brought a mouthful of water in a plastic cup. Hardly enough to keep well hydrated. When disembarking I spotted a water fountain with cups down the front end of economy I could have used, had I been able to get past the two large men sound asleep beside me - the perils of the window seat. I will try another airline for my next trip. ",10,7th June 2016,Australia
1355,"Manchester to Dubai with Emirates. It was disappointing - paid to upgrade to business class and maybe expected too much. After queuing for check in we were immediately welcomed by the staff saying ""You are on a saver business ticket so you can't use the lounge"". Yes we knew that, but thankyou for making us feel so welcome. Onboard we settled into row 18 in the lovely A380 seats. The cabin supervisor was coming through welcoming people onboard - she clearly missed us out and carried on. No smile or hello. We hadn't paid enough, obviously. Next my husbands seat did not recline or indeed move. The centre partition was jammed half way down. The cabin supervisor came over and shrugged. We will reset the seat and see what happens - it got stuck half way to lie flat. We changed seats off our own back but the only seats available together were in row 26 infront of the rowdy men's pub area (inflight bar). If you want a peaceful flight don't sit in the rear section. It's like lying down at a party. The food service started - they took our orders early on but oh dear, our choices weren't available. No apology even though they would have known that already at time of taking the order. The food we got was lovely but really - back row problem in any class obviously. After being at the party a while, listening to some loud stories and eating something we didn't really want we found yet 2 more individual seats further down the cabin to try and sleep. It was shoddy the whole trip. Downstairs it was half full and people no doubt had 3 seats each anyway. We upgraded not for the food but to lie down and be more comfortable. I guess we got that bit eventually but at a price we personally wouldn't pay for in the future.",9,6th June 2016,United Kingdom

They could have worked that out hours before as I was unable to eat the other selections. They said they would write it up to ensure it didn't happen again on the next flight but the next flight knew nothing about it. So the eat anytime wasn't true, nor was their resolution. The travel instructions for the business class driver showed the wrong address on his chit in Dubai. It was not the address we provided. Obviously we got lost. The lounges were very ordinary.

Comfortable lounge. On board brand new A380-800 was comfortable with all the latest gadgets. Food ok and wine list a credit to the selectors except for Champagne. Why would you choose such a large House as Moet which seems totally out of balance with the rest of the wine selections? Friendly service although not as professional as Singapore and Qatar. HKG-BKK on an older A380 was a real experience. Seats feel more cramped than the new version although I have read they are the same width. Nowhere to put your arms when reclining and it feels like a very cramped space. Food was downright awful and service was staff who in their attempt to be over friendly and hip just got it wrong. I would much pefer to pay the extra money for Singapore and Qatar where I am almost guaranteed of a better experience. Upon disembarkation the staff were very rude.

Completely oversold their family friendly service. It was a guessing game as to what we had to do with the stroller for our 7 month old. Although the kids meals were given as they had been pre-ordered I don't think they were particularly great quality. In terms of the cabin crew - rude, unfriendly and I could go on. We were issued the wrong menu - no apology. I asked for a glass of water for my little girl and it was as if I'd asked for gold. The serving of the food and drinks was very disjointed - no system, no organisation. I wasn't offered food twice as they bypassed me. My partner was missed out on a few occasions too. No apology. They didn't bother with the kids, I went to change the baby and when I was returning to my seat I had to wait in the aisle for 5 mins for them to move out of the way.

Boarding was late and done by Zone numbers on boarding passes. The agents were strict about it and I like that - board when it's your zone and not just push and shove. Friendly flight attendants throughout the flight except one attendant who was stoic and robotic. All the others were smiles and happy to get water or snacks. Smooth take off and delicious meal (and plenty of it) was served within 90 minutes of take off. Tons of movie/TV options on ICE - but wifi wasn't working. No big deal but Emirates touts it so much it was a bit of a bummer. Screaming kids throughout the flight - not EK fault but they put the families with children in the first 2 sections of economy so if you want quiet sit in the last 2 sections. Pizza snack provided mid-flight, and in the galley fresh fruit, drinks and snacks available throughout flight. Landing in Dubai around 1pm they provided a breakfast which was good but better if it had been a lunch due to the time. One thing - the seat is ok at first but after 10 hours your bottom will be sore. Bring your own pillow or cushion and save yourself some pain. Smooth landing and short taxi to Terminal 3, but sat on the plane an extra 20 minutes as gate agents had some issue with electrical connection to the plane for the APU.

On another tray with a sign that says no pork, there is another tray of small rolls with cheese and stuff etc. It was lunch time when we went in and I was hungry having had a 4 hour journey to get to the airport. A tray of danish pasties appeared from the kitchen, at lunch time. On another counter there were plastic bowls of pasta salad. Just pasta with a dollop of cesar dressing.

It ends up with the second line of means not being served consistently like the first. That is wine not served till food is done, etc. This actually needs managing and maybe a different approach.

At Dubai airport the Emirates ground staff service is abysmal, it has been that way for a long time, even the food in the business lounge can be best described as average.

Food was OK, though concerned that the quality has somewhat changed as opposed to previous flights with the airline. Some meals were nice, though could have been better in some aspects.

Dubai to Lisbon with Emirates. The B777-300 looked a bit tired compared to the B777-300ER, seat pitch seemed tighter, the entertainment screen was cracked and did not fully respond, the headsets were awful - seeming to increase engine noise and necessitating deafening volume to hear anything on screen. The seat cushion was a bit lacking in padding. Wine arrived early but from about climb out and for nearly 3 hours we experienced severe turbulence and in spite of regular calls for seat belts to be fastened and even the crew having to return to their seats for lengthy periods the service was somehow maintained. Dinner this time was king prawns with rice and greens in sweet chile sauce and better than we have often had in business class. The approach to Lisbon was equally bumpy but finishing with an excellent smooth landing about 20 minutes late. When I complimented the purser on the staff performance she invited me to their area at the rear to repeat my comments ""because I want them all to hear your compliments"" and gave me a couple of Drambuies to take home as a souvenir.

The cabin crew were excellent - smart and friendly as always - to the extent that, knowing the habit of serving drinks after the food, I asked for a wine when getting seated and it was brought even before we were at cruising height. The seafood meal of chargrilled salmon was delicious and accompanied by yet another wine. After dinner coffee was accompanied by a wide range of liqueurs. Cabin staff were regularly coming through the cabin to offer drinks and to check after passenger comfort and finished with ice-cream about an hour before landing. The other thing to mention is the 'assisted passenger service' which was superb at both ends with a helper staying with you from check-in to the aircraft door and again from aircraft door to pick-up transport and then actually refusing a tip.",7,10th May 2016,Portugal
1373,"✅ Verified Review |  I was flying Emirates from Muscat to New York via Dubai, with a friend who has an Arabic last name. During boarding we were called aside at the boarding counter as his name had to undergo an additional security clearance. We were the first ones to commence the boarding procedure, but after 2 hours of waiting they still had not resolved the issue. They told us the visa was OK, and that it was some kind of issue in the Emirates systems. We were not told exactly what the issue was, all we could see was that the boarding desk in Dubai was arguing with the Emirates office in JFK for the boarding release. The debate affected three travelling parties. Despite the flight already being 45 minutes delayed the JFK office refused to support the Dubai ground staff in clearing the passengers, but instead opted to open a roughly half-hour general debate with the Dubai desk on how to use the system and on the trainings they needed. This debate was held on loud-speaker. Long story, short: In the end I was told to board the plane alone or lose my flight while my friend was offloaded to take a following flight. (Curiously enough 5 minutes after Emirates closed the flight my friend was cleared, but by then it was too late to get aboard). I ended up waiting for him half a day at JFK. I found the whole incident to be quite unprofessional, and I believe the airline ground staff (especially in JFK) should collaborate more in the interest of the customer rather than power playing games with each other. This is the third incident I had with Emirates (I was once told to choose another carrier if I didn’t like flying with Emirates after they kept delaying my flights for 2 working days).

1374,"✅ Verified Review |  Mauritius to Guangzhou via Dubai. Overall, Emirates is good.  From Mauritius to Dubai, the A380 was full, and service was okay. At Dubai Airport I find nothing interesting and the wait is long, 5 hours or so.

1375,✅ Verified Review |  Birmingham to Adelaide via Dubai with Emirates. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was in an A380 and OK but seat was narrow for business class. We switched to a Boeing 777-300 in Dubai. Can't help thinking anyone in economy who was able to lie across 3 seats would have had a better trip. The Boeing 777 seats are at a 15 degree angle so your legs can not be flat. This flight seemed understaffed. Too few bathrooms which were tiny and not always clean. The focus seemed to be on serving those who wanted alcohol throughout the flight rather than basic quality care to everyone. Definitely not value for money - at best I would describe it as poor premium class.,9,2nd May 2016,Australia
1376,"What happened to Emirates? This airline misconnected our baggage on the way back from Bangkok and as a result our one night and day in Istanbul were totally ruined. To make matters worse they have the most disgraceful staff representing them at IST airport. A third party agency whose staff ask ""what our problem is?"" After waiting 2 hours and only being given 50 dollars to cloth ourselves, no explanation where our baggage is or when it will arrive. On top of this complete disaster the inflight service was terrible, with inexperienced crew having absolutely no idea how to do their job. Will never fly Emirates again.",7,29th April 2016,Malta

Chauffeur driven Mercedes to Emirates entrance at Gatwick.  Fast track through security is not that fast. Boarding gate is a walk away from the lounge. Priority boarding to top deck of the A380. Greetings at the door. I like seat 16K, mini bar is aisle side giving you well defined privacy, plenty of storage in the stowage below the two windows. The décor, some say bling, suits me. 15 inch screen, with separate tablet, so watch a movie and monitor the flight at the same time. Business class seats have aisle access. Served pre departure drink, with a drinks menu if required. Amenity kits are handed out on night flights, Bvlgary fragrances. On this leg, I elected to forego onboard meal and sleep, and the crew woke me for a meal. 4 hrs sleep and headed to the rear bar area which was buzzing.  Food is plentiful in finger picking style. Hennessey XO brandy and other branded spirits. The crew make flying fun. After arriving into Dubai, the lounge is the same, good food and drinks, lift to the boarding gate. Next sector to Mauritius and 7 hours to enjoy another flight.

1378,"Manchester to Bangkok via Dubai with Emirates. The first leg of our journey was great, we had the friendliest stewardess I have encountered she was just lovely and we travel regularly with a number of different long haul airlines. She took time to chat to the passengers - even though the flight was full, kept us topped up with drinks, snacks and meals and even took our photograph, it made the flight fun and go quickly. The plane was clean and although not one of the newest, comfortable and everything worked. On the second leg we were on a new A380, again the staff were friendly and responsive but we slept most of the way. The seats were comfortable and the plane was clean and the food tasty and plentiful. We did the same journey but obviously the other way around on our return to the UK, all fine although a bumpy flight but the staff were not as friendly and it did jade the experience.

1379,"✅ Verified Review |  Never ever fly Emirates if it is outside the Gulf region (they are good only for short distance local sectors in the gulf), especially to Asian cities like Hong Kong, Bangkok or Singapore. My trip to Bangkok and Hong Kong last week was a trauma, or a nightmare I can't get over, with them misplacing my luggage - on both flights - back to back and then in Bangkok it wasn't delivered until I had to leave the country, when I got it from their departure counter just in time to leave the country. In Hong Kong, they misplaced it (""erroneously"" according to the response of the customer service staff) only to have it delivered the next day to my hotel. Also, their customer service staff is irrational and do not respond in time to queries unless few email reminders are sent to them. I'd never recommend Hong Kong at all, since Emirates does not have a counter there to attend to baggage misplaced by them, it is outsourced to an agency (Jardine services) who don't speak English properly.

1380,"Amsterdam - Dubai with Emirates. I had the outbound flight to Dubai in the evening. Diner service started late (about 2 hours after take-off), so it was hard to get a good rest as everyone was walking around and the lights were still on.

1381,"✅ Verified Review |  Brisbane to Stockholm via Dubai. I have been flying with Emirates for the last 15 years. I did stop for a couple of years when they went really bad in almost every aspect, but lately they have picked up on service and everything. On my recent flight though there were many things not right again. The service with Emirates is hit and miss. You can get lucky with extremely polite and efficient staff or very unlucky with poor staff. On this trip I experienced both. When a flight attendant replies to guest complaint about the ice cold, ie. not heated food with the answer she could not know I wanted it hot, then there is something severely wrong. Within Asia you will have good staff, within Europe you won't. The new A380 is a pleasure to fly, it is more spacious and new. The second leg of my journey was on an older model, a Boeing 777-300 and that was awful. It is impossible to move, eat, sit or do anything. My worst concern was the disgusting food.  Also my folding table was dirty, so they might want to look into cleanliness.

The seats for economy are very comfortable and for me plenty of room (I'm about 5'8). The flight attendants are friendly throughout the flight. The thing I look forward the most are the meals which are delicious. I'd recommend joining their rewards program if you use Emirates regularly as you start getting enough points to reach Silver/Gold membership. For me the benefits were, checking in can be done in a separate line or the business class counter, then when boarding members are called to board before everyone else and in Dubai you have access to the business class lounge, makes the economy flight much nicer.",7,15th April 2016,Australia
1383,"✅ Verified Review |  Horrible airline that leaves customers stranded and out of pocket. My original flight was to depart 4th April from Tokyo Haneda to Brussels via Dubai. I had a connecting Eurostar booked from Brussels to London, which is my final destination. Due to the unfortunate events at Brussels, my flight from Dubai to Brussels was cancelled. However, I was informed (with a lousy text) less than 24hrs before the first leg to Dubai. I then had to contact customer service and spent hours trying to get my flight rerouted. 1st, they wouldn't take me to my final destination which was London, nor did they offer me a reroute to bring me back to Brussels to catch my Eurostar to London. They said my ticket could not be refunded due to ticket class (when they cancelled the flight) so I could not book another flight to get myself home to London. They said the only way I could go to London with Emirates was to top up EUR700, which is ridiculous. They told me to ring back every 2-3 hours to check if I got on a rerouted flight as all forwarding flights from Dubai were overbooked (I was in a completely different timezone, had to wake up every few hours, and less than 20 hours before my first leg was to depart) and they also emphasised that if I arrived in Dubai and was not confirmed on a connecting flight (I'll be in the air, so I wouldn't know till I landed), I will have to cover my own accomodation in Dubai till a connecting flight could be confirmed. Extremely frustrated with the situation, I told them to book me on the first confirmed flight that I could get all the way from Tokyo to Paris, which resulted in me being stranded in Tokyo for 2 additional days. I also had to pay for a new Eurostar ticket back to London as Emirates would not cover it. Adding a cherry to the cake, my luggage did not arrive with me in Paris (which I did attempt to check at Dubai that the luggage did make it to the connecting plane, and I was assured it did). After much arguing, Emirates baggage staff assured me that they will send the luggage to my forwarding address directly in London. Fast forward to 13th April, rang Emirates in the past few days only to find that they didn't know where my luggage was other than it was put on a flight to Heathrow on 8th April. Yesterday, the French office told me to call Heathrow myself to look for it. After arguing with them, they then contacted their UK team and located my bag at the airport. Emirates French office customer service then told me to go to Heathrow T5 Belt XX to collect my delayed luggage. I was infuriated and instead of offering to arrange delivery to me as they had promised on the 6th April, she offered me an email address to contact to try and 'convince them to send it to me'. I don't believe they have adhered to their conditions of carriage in both instances with my cancelled flight and delayed baggage but the airline has not offered me any compensation nor apology and I am still waiting on getting my delayed luggage back from the most incompetent airline.

He scared me saying, I will be charged $150 fee for my carry on bag since I have a laptop bag also. He reiterated only 1 piece of baggage can be carried on board on a A380. Very poor form and service. I didn't expect this from Emirates. I declined his offer and proceeded with my carry on and laptop bag. Nobody stopped me at the gate.

1385,"✅ Verified Review |  After traveling on long distances routes with various carriers over the last 5 years I decided to go back and revisit Emirates in the A380 transiting in Dubai. I'm happy I did. Flew Hong Kong to Madrid via Dubai. Emirates seem much improved to me. The upper deck in the A380 is peerless, but there are a number of things that set Emirates apart now, in my opinion. The ground staff and transit interactions in Dubai, at least in Business, are just head and shoulders above anything else. The Business Departures is actually separate and you enter the plane directly from the lounge: stress-free, anyone? No lines, no hassle, no hysteria. The synergy is seamless. I love Cathay and Hong Kong, but they don't have that. JFK or Heathrow? Dream on. I recently had an appalling transit experience with Turkish in Istanbul and I would say this flight on Emirates showed how much more professional and logistically advanced Emirates are than that overrated carrier. Not to mention that the Dubai lounges are huge with great food and smiling staff. On board: again, top service, attentive and unfailingly good-humored. The walnut panelling is really nice, the cabins are soothing and elegant. The inflight screens are huge and crystal clear, wide selection of multi-lingual movies, including new releases from Korea and Japan. Food was superb, and I mean superb. For the first time in years I actually enjoyed the entire experience of a 14 hour flight. Moreover, they offer free limo service in every city you arrive in: they don't botch the reservations and the guys are waiting for you at the gate. What! Given that their prices are average, I would say Emirates now outclass almost every other long distance carrier if we except the Japanese, Korean Air, Singapore and Cathay, and maybe Quantas. But do any of these offer the add ons and extras that Emirates offer? I'll have to try a few of them in the near future. However, for the time being I am switching my allegiance to Emirates because they have cracked the nut on this one. Certainly, going East-West via Dubai there's no competitor.",10,13th April 2016,Thailand

All flights left in time and arrived in time. Food was good quality. Frequent beverage services during all the flights. Great entertainment system. Seats with good legroom. Negative: Seats on the airplane did not match those selected in the seating chart during booking. Seats should pitch a bit more. Meal services quick but not timed very good in our opinion; at some point all of our family felt really hungry, especially our teenagers (6 hours between light snack and dinner).

1387,"A real tale of two halves flying with Emirates. Boarding at Birmingham was fine. Seat pitch was ok for someone who is 6'6"". Food and entertainment both acceptable. However, the service on both this leg and the Dubai to Bangkok leg was sadly lacking. Pressing the call button usually resulted in a 10-15 minute wait. The same couldn't be said for the return legs 2 weeks late where the crew couldn't have been more attentive. Couple of points of note: The A380 is a wonderful aircraft. Spacious, bright, quiet and comfortable. If you are sat towards the front downstairs there is a slight lack of overhead locker space due to the way the aircraft tapers in. It is much quieter sitting at the front compared to elsewhere in the aircraft so do try and sit in the forward cabin. Boarding was hit and miss at both DXB and BKK. Some announcements were done via the tannoy and some by the ground crew shouting out instructions. From DXB to BKK, there was a drunken passenger who kept singing and waking passengers up. The crew kept coming to speak to him but then also kept bringing him drinks. The situation could have been handled better. Now that the A380 is flying into/out of BHX, will certainly look to book with Emirates again in the future",3,9th April 2016,United Kingdom
1388,"✅ Verified Review |  I stepped onboard my Emirates flight from London Gatwick to Phuket via Dubai to that lovely aroma of business class. It's not a normal thing for me to travel in business class, but it isn't a distant dream anymore. The seats appealed to me, and I loved the layout. Once I had settled in, I spotted one flaw, which was the lack of storage everywhere, but the storage available just about accommodated all my items. Once we had taken off, I sat down to what I would have described as a 'bumpy flight' coming from a nervous flyer though. However, the wide selection of movies, space available for sleep and excellent dining occupied my thoughts to more important things. There are only a couple of words to describe this cabin - beautiful, elegant and stylish. The second flight had a more tranquil atmosphere in a smaller cabin with a different design, due to an older, smaller plane. The entertainment was a little disappointing, as the response for all the channels (which were very limited) was far from instant. The dining started and ended on a slightly different tone, it couldn't disappoint. Overall I strongly recommend Emirates.",6,7th April 2016,United Kingdom
1389,"✅ Verified Review |  I chose Emirates for 3 reasons, ability to fly out of Boston, pricing, and desire to experience the A380 for the first time. I had flown EK once previously, a HKG-BKK one way several years ago. I was aware of their 4 star ranking and recalled from my previous trip that I felt that accurate. I am not sure that I would give them a solid 4 ranking based on these two flights. First, the good. Despite a miserable snowstorm in Boston we only had a brief delay in departure and made up time enroute. The flight only had 130 passengers so boarding was quick and easy. I would have thought that the high ratio of FAs to pax would have resulted in exemplary service. Not so. There was no drink service offered and an hour after takeoff, needing to take some medicine, I was finally able to flag down the Purser who promptly took care of me and checked back several times throughout the flight. Pity the rest of the crew were not so attentive. One appeared annoyed when I asked for another drink and pressing the call button was ignored. Though the bell sounded and the light went on, the FA told me it wasn't working when I walked back to the galley. The food at lunch suffered from the long delay in serving it. The chicken pesto sounded great but was too difficult to cut let alone chew. The bread (in cellophane) was cold. The flight itself was very smooth. Changing to the A380 in Dubai was trying due to the extreme heat and the mass of people. Once aboard I found that the seat I had selected from a seating chart was not where I expected it to be. Aisle seat next to the middle galley. I was banged into by FAs the entire flight, rarely with an apology. The service trolleys were continually blocking every aisle in every direction making a trip to the pitifully scare restrooms an ordeal. The food was better than the trip out. So good, in fact, that the FAs were continually eating. I have never seen so many FAs consuming food in plain view of pax. Again, smooth flights but service wise I would be hard pressed to give this a sold 4 star rating. No comparison to the level of service on Qatar, which thankfully had just begun service out of Boston. Am hoping the flight back home in two weeks are better.",2,6th April 2016,United States

I tried many times to check in and choose my seat but the system locked me out. When I made a phone call to Emirates they told me of their inability to do a thing about it. This resulted in being allocated a horrible seat in the middle, for the 13 hours long flight with the aisle person making it almost impossible for me to even go to the toilet. Topping it up the Emirates staff was unresponsive on the plane. When the staff was called they did not come even after pressing the tab 5 times. The entertainment system had so many glitches that I could hardly watch it. The worse thing was the bus from the plane to the terminal herding us like cattle.  The experience was not to end there since when I got my luggage back from the conveyor belt the lock was broken. When I sent the complaint to Emirates they said sorry for the things but passing on the blame to the respective authorities.",1,3rd April 2016,Australia

We expressed concerns to the staff in London and were assured that we would not miss our connecting flight. Onboard the flight the crew said they could not be certain if we will make the flight as it depends which Gate etc the flight would be on. This left us confused and apprehensive for the rest of our flight. As we arrived in Dubai at 0100, we were met by a Emirate representative who said we had already been offloaded the flight and had us booked on the next flight at 0745 the next morning. They gave us a meal voucher and said that is the best they could do. The staff said because of immigration rules they cannot offer anything to passengers if it is less than 8 hours. There was no empathy and I do not blame the staff from connections to the lounges we spoke to, as they kept referring there are no managers on duty who are empowered to authorize a place to rest and this is standard policy for missed flights arising due to delays.

I got about 5 hours of sleep before landing. The second leg in the 777-300 is very different. I sat in the aisle seat and my partner had the window. Unlike the A380 window and middle seats of the 2-3-2 layout need to clamber over the aisle seat to get in and out. Seats are comfortable but not full flat bed when reclined.

1400,"✅ Verified Review |  London Heathrow to Dhaka via Dubai, returning to Newcastle via Dubai. London Heathrow to Dubai started off well as I only had hand luggage so getting to gate was a breeze thanks to Emirates easy and intuitive mobile check-in. It all went downhill from here though. On boarding was clear my ICE seat back screen was not working or responding. Worse it wouldn't switch off and kept flickering. I informed a member of the cabin crew about the issue but there wasn't a lot of enthusiasm or effort made to help. I asked if could be switched off if it could not be made to work, and never heard anything for the rest of the flight leaving me with flickering screen to contend with for 8 hours which was distracting and didn't really help me sleep on a night flight. I understand things go wrong and am reasonable but its how you handle things that matters. Once over Dubai, landing was delayed and we were put in holding pattern for 1.5 hours due to fog. We were informed that ground staff would be on hand to help those with missed connections and those that had tight ones to make and I was relieved at first to see a lot of staff about. However it seemed they were only helping certain people and when I asked, I got yelled at very disrespecftfully to go look at the departure board. I was left to fend for myself when I only had 20 minutes to get my gate for the flight to Dhaka which was showing as ""Final Call"". Infuriated and out of breath I arrived at the gate just in time to be met with a surly and unapologetic gate staff. I was then shoved on bus in the Dubai heat and we were left there for half an hour without any updates past take-off time. We were then bussed to the cargo terminal where our plane was parked and boarded and then left for a further 45 minutes without much information. The saving grace of the DXB-DAC sector was the crew were quite friendly and warm, and unusually the catering was rather nice. Returning DAC-DXB, even getting into the aiport was a nightmare due the corruption and difficulties that have returned with using Dhaka airport and the use of the local airlines Biman handling team is slow and innefficient. The hassling for money of my elderly mother from her requested assistance was also unwelcome. The flight itself DAC-DXB was uneventful, but the food was atrocious even by Emirates standards - almost inedible. Thas was repeated on the DXB-NCL sector as well. All in all very much going downhill, even the hard product is showing some weariness and there's complacency in improvements on these - the 10 abreast seating on Boeing 777's is horrific. Staff attitude has always been their weak point but it has got particularly bad to the point of contempt, especially when things go wrong. All in all there doesn't seem to be any benefit of flyng Emirates anymore - other carriers do this better now.

My experience on the outbound flights was not good and unless something pretty good happens on the way back, I wouldn't recommend them or use them again. The positive was the entertainment system which was good quality and a good selection and check in was efficient and pleasant. Seats were uncomfortable (hard) and the seat on the second leg was broken so it wouldn't lock in recline mode (flight full, so no spares). The quality of the food was not good and out of the three meals over the journey, two of them had ran out of one of the two choices supposedly available, so locked into a dish I did not want. Whilst the crew were pleasant enough the service was really bare bones and seem to focus around the main meal times rather than between times. The second leg of the flight was extremely cold in the cabin and despite people raising it, it didn't improve. Blankets all round. Broadband was woeful despite paying for it and I gave up in the end.

The cabin crew was very nice and friendly, the seat back screens were the biggest I have seen in economy class, and the economy toilets were quite large. I had plenty of room to move around the toilets, and they had air freshener in there. The seats were comfy with lots of leg room, and the blanket they provided was quite long. When it was dark outside, they had little ""starry"" lights on the roof of the cabin to mimick the night sky. ",1,24th March 2016,Australia
1405,"Sydney to Christchurch. Arrived about 07:45 for 10:15 scheduled departure. Upon arrival at the airport it was obvious something was up, check-in row was E, queue snaked all the way to C. It took about 40 minutes for someone from Emirates to show up, in flight attendant gear, that knew what was going on (destination immigration system down, requiring manual checking of passports, etc). Some supervisors walked around looking harried, and useless. Anyway, having done online check-in again saved some time. Overall check-in would have taken more than an hour. At check-in desk I was made to take my cameras out of carry on and put camera bag in hold (12 kgs, my partner had less so we would have been within the allowance of twice 7 kgs but got ""it is for your safety"" lines, full flight etc), never had to do that. Anyway my lenses survived the trip. What was worse is that rules seemed totally inconsistent in terms of application.  Hold luggage we had no more than 2/3 of our 32 kgs each allowance. Onboard service in line with Emirates reputation, in terms of quality of seating (Boeing 777-300 with ten across) food, friendly attendants, 13 languages across them). Upon arrival in NZ very surprised with both passport control and customs/ quarantine being so friendly compared to Sydney Airport.",1,24th March 2016,Australia
1406,"My Emirates route was Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai, connecting to Yangon with Bangkok Airways. Hamburg to Dubai was delayed so I needed to rush to the other Gate which was unfortunately in another Terminal. From the stopover time of about 1.5 hrs I had left before boarding 20 mins. The rest of the time was the Bus from a parking position to the Gate, which took 25 mins. The flight from DBX to BKK was delayed as well, so again from around 1.5 hrs stop over was only 40 mins left until departure. There again I needed to run from the arrival gate to the departure gate, passing security once again, I made to be at the depature gate about 5 min before depature, luckily Bangkok Airways was waiting so I could take the flight. Arriving in Yangon, my luggage was lost in Bangkok due to the short stopover time. To get the paperwork done at the airport was a kind of journey, but it arrived in my hotel in the evening. The service on board is okay, nothing special. Mostly the staff was friendly and if you ask for drinks they will bring it to you. However it takes forever until they clean up the trays from the seat, which was not acceptable. Normally the stopover times were more then sufficient, however all of them ended up to be in a rush or to run through the airport to catch the next flight. Dubai Airport looks nice, but is very badly organized, and this for a new Airport! I know Emirates can be cheap, but I prefer to have a smooth journey and not to be in hurry all the time.

1407,"The business class on the A380 is one of the best business class seats in my opinion. I love the layout of the cabin, the privacy especially if you select the rows which have the seat right next to the window, plenty of storage space, and great IFE. The food option was tremendous. My only complaint, like on several of my recent flights with Emirates, is that the onboard wifi works terribly. It was painstakingly slow and a complete waste of even my $1!",9,19th March 2016,Singapore
1408,"We flew Emirates on Feb 14 on A380 from Dulles, Washington, DC to Dubai then on a B777 to Delhi. A380 is very quiet and a much smoother ride since it flies at a higher altitude. All flights were on time but the quality of service is not the same, they used to have a drink service before dinner or lunch which does not happen anymore. Now they bring the lunch and dinner followed by drinks. Washington to Dubai leg, service was much better than Dubai to Delhi leg. Still a pretty good airline and good service. We left Delhi on Feb 27 to spend 4 days in Dubai, back to USA on 2 March, 2016, we experienced a similar service.",10,16th March 2016,United States
1409,"Change of seat at the last minute due to a different 777-300ER configuration leading to be reallocated one of the worst set of seats in business class (seats 6A and 6B) from Dubai to Colombo. No contact made by Emirates on this change early enough to seek better seating. When loading with economy passengers my wife was continually bashed with their large walk-on luggage, she had to move to one side to avoid in being hit. When inflight a very cold draft was continually experienced even with our personal valves shut off. Entertainment very good, but video quality on older aircraft poor. Staff service quality varied between flights from very good to poor.",7,15th March 2016,United Kingdom
1410,"I have been a long time fan of Emirates from the 90's, when they provided enough competition to make flying more humane from the antipodes. More recently though I have been less than satisfied with their service levels and customer service, this has accelerated since the ""merger"" of routes with Qantas. This flight was not so pleasant - the flight was delayed from Gatwick due to an oil spill and impacted the whole journey. The inflight service was generally good, food okay, the A380 seats are in the top quartile at the price point for comfort and pitch, I was comfortable on the A380 for the whole journey despite being a tall Aussie. I even snagged some good seats near the bulkhead which made legroom no problem. The 777 segment from Dubai to Melbourne (via Malaysia) was not pleasant. The planes are older, tired, have narrower seats and I was uncomfortable the whole journey. Try and avoid any Emirates segments that use this older equipment, it generally sours your experience of Emirates. The main problems I had with this journey was the late departure. The 4 hour delay caused me to miss my booked connection, and I was put onto the dog-leg segment via Malaysia. Emirates have refused any form of compensation in breach of European rules and refused to supply any assistance at the journey end for this delay. The obnoxious behaviour of customer service staff makes me rethink my loyalty to this brand.",10,14th March 2016,United Kingdom
1411,"Dubai to Warsaw with Emirates. My seats, selected 3 month before the flight, were changed without any notice. When we boarded a plane they told me that they cannot do anything about that because aircraft was full. Seat belt was not working and the seat was broken. When we complain about it three times they said that they will check what can be done and will let us know. No one came to explain anything. We were really disappointed.",9,13th March 2016,Poland
1412,"This was my third encounter with Emirates. First the booking did not go through and I had to call the office with 10 min in waiting. Got it finally and confirmed my seats at night. Woke up to drive to the Airport, checked my emails and had a new itinerary for the next day flight. I was 45 min on hold and finally given a reason of bad weather. Wasn't offered anything, not even the later flight. Had to fill in my own refund request. You cannot do anything for the weather, but not letting passengers know is just not good enough.",9,13th March 2016,Australia
1413,"Flew Emirates business class from Birmingham to Bangkok via Dubai on 1 March, comfortable flight with no problems. However return journey on 9th was a completely different story. Total lack of customer care. I appreciate problems were caused by the storm in UAE, but this does not excuse Emirates of customer care. No information was supplied in Bangkok as to rescheduled flight and connections and therefore had 12 hour wait. Once on board flight the crew were indifferent and unhelpful. Arrived in Dubai and no help with connection flight. Went to business lounge and was told we had been downgraded to economy and we had 27 minutes to make the flight or would have to wait for 2 days for another flight. Was told luggage would be transferred on flight so we decided to run to catch the flight. Seated next to toilet and disturbed by smell and passengers all flight. Arrived at Birmingham to be told luggage was still in Dubai. Have yet to be contacted about compensation for downgrade or delayed baggage despite making complaint at BHX. I think Emirates is on the slippery slope of becoming arrogant and then awful.",10,12th March 2016,United Kingdom
1414,"I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare.  The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome.  Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was there with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves.  Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes. I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again, different attendant but same story! I was forced to sit upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! Emirates boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead.",5,12th March 2016,Australia
1415,"The Emirates A380 product is very good, although the seats in business class are rather tight, especially in fully flat position. Food was okay. The real issue is the diverse quality of the cabin crew: on the leg from DXB to ZRH they were just okay. From BKK to DXB I flew First: nobody addressed me by my name with the exception of the cabin crew director when she introduced herself to me. The service was not efficient, neither friendly nor First Standard. ",3,12th March 2016,Switzerland
1416,"Sensational experience on Emirates A380-800 from Bangkok to Newcastle via Dubai on March 10th. The cabin crew on this flight were fantastic. I fly through the Middle East a lot on business and have never encountered such a professional, well trained cabin crew.  Another major plus was the extra leg room. ",4,11th March 2016,United Kingdom
1417,"Singapore to Brisbane with Emirates was our last flight of a two week trip, so we were a tired family when we boarded. We couldn't believe our luck when we got row 23 (pretty sure that was the row number) which was facing the bulkhead. Plenty of room for the four of us to spread out and also to stretch our legs. The two attendants who looked after us made the four of us feel special. I wish I had taken the name of the Austrian attendant as she deserved special mention.",7,10th March 2016,Australia
1418,"It was my third trip to Indonesia, and I had always chosen Emirates for that. Me and my mate were flying from Jakarta to Malpensa, via Dubai. The first flight was ok, while the Dubai to Malpensa flight was horrible. A passenger had a health problem when we had just taken our seats and we had to wait about two hours. Then the passenger and his wife left the plane. But the wrong luggage was taken from the plane, and another bag not belonging to anyone was shown by a steward to us all. None of the staff apologised for the delay or inconvenience. I arrived at Malpensa two hours late and very tired, having started my trip the day before in Yogyakarta. The A380 has no place for standing up, just to change position and relax the body in a many hours trip. It is filled with seats and nothing else. I will not choose Emirates for my next flights.",10,9th March 2016,Italy
1419,"I flew Business Class for the first time on an Emirates upgrade offer from Auckland to Melbourne. Incredible experience, so much space in terms of the seat which also offered a huge variety of functionality, great crew who were really friendly and really enjoyed the bar area at the back of the plane. Great flight and airline, would definitely recommend!",10,9th March 2016,United Kingdom
1420,"Chose Emirates as part of our package holiday to the Maldives. It was a bit of a mixed bag: I did my back in badly the day before the long flights. Walking/sitting was a real struggle. When we arrived at Heathrow we got a wheelchair and asked about an upgrade. I was not looking for it to be free but hoped a concession could be made. There was no movement however we were given a front seat in economy so I could move around as freely as possible. My discomfort was not a negative against the economy seats as ordinarily there would have been no issue. The A380 flight out I couldn't really settle in to. The food was excellent and immediate service good. The lead attendant saw the pain I was in and said if there was anything he could do just ask. I appreciate their ability to do anything to help me was extremely limited however because of my discomfort I couldn't enjoy the in-flight entertainment but again, not their fault. Transfers etc in Dubai went well. They appeared a bit chaotic but it seemed to be controlled chaos. Because of my condition we were shepherded to a holding area where I could be taken to the right gate at the right time. The 777 flight to Male I slept through as took a strong sedative to knock me out, however I did wake for breakfast which was again very good. By the time we flew back my back was feeling a bit better so I could appreciate the in-flight entertainment more and it really is excellent. A huge choice of music, films, tv shows to eat away the hours whilst flying. The A380 we had from Dubai to Heathrow was newer than on the way out and the tv screen in economy was about the size of an ordinary laptop screen, which I thought was excellent. It was touch-screen and again the food was excellent. My only negatives (discounting my bad back which obviously wasn't Emirates fault) were that I enquired about an upgrade to business class from Dubai to Heathrow. Quoted $5000 for 2 people, which I thought was ridiculous however we wanted to finish off the holiday in style so offered $4000. Didn't move. Would they rather not sell the seats and make the extra cash anyway? She told me that Dubai had the highest upgrade charge of any airport in the word. The flight back from Dubai to London, whilst more comfortable with excellent food and in-flight entertainment, we really felt like we were economy. You get what you pay for I suppose but having your (and your girlfriends) flight-attendant call button on for 20+ mins with no response and no-one going past is unacceptable. I only wanted a drink. In the end I gave up and waited for food to be served but in typical British fashion, didn't say anything. They bragged about having in-flight Wifi. I personally didn't try to connect but my girlfriend did and had zero joy. So, overall very good. A few grumbles where perhaps they could have been more adaptable but recently flew BA to Barbados and Emirates pretty much topped them in every department.",5,8th March 2016,United Kingdom
1421,"Since we were traveling with golfbags I phoned Emirates in Amsterdam requesting for a Van or MPV to pick us up for our transfer to the airport. A few hours before pick up time we received a call confirming our request and indeed we were picked up by a van. Smooth check in, we could hand-over our golfbags to the groundstaff who delivered them to the special luggage desk. Emirates uses the Aspire lounge in Amsterdam which is hard to find due all ongoing renovation work in this airport. Boarding went OK in group, F and C passengers boarding straight to the upper deck. Arrival in Dubai in the B-concourse and we had to disembark via the forward stairs, making all Y passengers wait. Transfer was smooth, we used the Emirates longe in the C-concourse which was very crowded at that time of the day. In Mauritius the luggage was delivered using 2 belts, one for F/C and one for Y. Our luggage was delivered quickly, the golfbags were hand delivered from a different belt, again a very good service. Being seated in the middle (E/F paired) seats, both of us were served by different flight attendants. We asked them in the beginning of both flights whether they could synchronize their service as much as possible, and this worked perfectly. Cabin crew were very nice and attentive. On both flights the food was plenty and of good quality.",4,8th March 2016,Netherlands
1422,"Glasgow to Hong Kong via Dubai with Emirates. The A380 is superb, and this makes for an interesting comparison with the Boeing 777 used on the GLA sector. The latter suffers from ten-across seating in economy, which is okay for GLA-DXB flight duration, but I would resent for any sector more than eight hours or so. Otherwise, recommended. The inflight entertainment system is the best I have ever used.",10,7th March 2016,United Kingdom
1423,London Heathrow to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. As a nervous flyer the cabin crew were aware of it and they couldn't have been more attentive and considerate. This was based on the fact that the flight was quite empty so he said he had more time to spend with me. The food was amazing and the inflight entertainment is exceptional. On the way back it was a Qantas flight and their flight staff couldn't give a monkeys that I was terrified. As far as I'm concerned Emirates are outstanding compared to Qantas.,7,7th March 2016,Australia
1424,"A quality product and service across the Tasman with Emirates from Sydney to Auckland. If you are an economy passenger on this route this is the only sensible alternative. 32-34 inches of space on a wide body jet compared to the cramped narrow bodied aircraft of QF or NZ. Service with a smile, economy meals that include extras QF did away with years ago to cut costs. Buy it with a QF flight number and you still get points, status credits and lounge access if a Club member.",7,7th March 2016,Australia
1425,"Colombo to Melbourne via Singapore. I was allocated the wrong seat from check-in despite having booked it 2 months ago. I wouldn't have minded except that the new seat was near the toilets. When I inquired, it was found the seat I booked was still vacant. The ground staff at the boarding gate in Colombo were not very helpful except for one staff officer from Emirates. He was very professional and made the seat correction promptly.",6,7th March 2016,Australia
1426,"Flew with Emirates for the first time. JFK to Bangkok with layover in Dubai. I chose this flight due to short layover. All would be great if the flight was not delayed. We left JFK later than projected and ended up missing our flight from Dubai to Bangkok, resulting is a 8 hour layover. Emirates were not exactly sympathetic or apologetic and only after much fuss provided us with a few dollar worth food voucher (incorrectly printed for 3 passengers only rather than 4, which they were not happy to fix either). The flight was ok. A380 is an impressive plane. Seat are relatively comfortable in economy section, entertainment selection was very good. Food and drink service was ok. The crew was very international and not super friendly. Our seats were close to the galley and the staff not only left the curtain constantly opened, letting bright light in, they were also extremely loud, chit chatting, laughing. When I asked a flight attendant if she could close the curtain in order to reduce noise and make it darker so we could sleep she just walked away, returning in a few minutes with ear plugs, which I never requested. Eventually we ended up moving to the back of the plane (as flight was only half full) and had a peaceful reminder of the trip. Return flight from Bangkok to Dubai was also delayed. At some point there was airport security on board going through all carry-ons.  However afterwards the flight took off and was uneventful, with same okay food/drink service and not overly friendly the international crew. Overall I was not very impressed with Emirates, their flight attendants could be more friendly and on ground crew could me more helpful. ",1,6th March 2016,United States
1427,"Dubai to Paris with Emirates, and this time with my kids we have experienced an overbooking. At the checkin counter they told us we have no seats and have to go to another counter where they told us you have no seat, so we offer you an hotel 5 stars, dinner and breakfast (it was already midnight and the next flight scheduled at 7 am). I said I refused and they immediatly found 3 seats next each other. So problem solved quite quickly. The flight was good, the seat is comfortable. Food is good, staff is really nice.",2,6th March 2016,France
1428,"Flight no issues, inflight entertainment was not as expected or advertised. Food was not good at all. On my flight back to SA, the only good option I had was vegetable and was told that the other options were not available as it was finished. Most of the time cabin crew had to be asked twice as they had forgotten. Just some info for passengers, if you are asleep while serving food you will be left to sleep.",2,5th March 2016,South Africa
1429,"Our flights to and from Cape Town using Emirates for the first time were in the main very good for economy class. The 777-300 ER is a fine aircraft, but as a lot of reviewers have mentioned with Emirates having a 3-4-3 seating arrangement it does make it quite cramped, and being in an aisle seat I was constantly bumped into with people moving up and down the aisle. The crews on all our flights were very good, happy and willing to serve and help the passengers. The food for economy class was very good indeed, and the individual menu was a nice touch, and there were plenty of water and juice runs throughout the flights. Compared to other airlines I've flown with, Emirates don't have a general bar service before they serve their meals, although they do offer wine, water or juice with your meal, but right behind the meal service comes the bar service which just felt odd. The ICE entertainment system was excellent, large screens, huge selection of films, TV, and music to while away your flight, and the external cameras showed you views you normally don't get to see unless you are a pilot. If Emirates changed to a 3-3-3 seating arrangement and increased the pitch too they would offer their economy passengers a fantastic service instead of a very good service.",1,3rd March 2016,United Kingdom
1430,"So I finally flew with Emirates and apart from one thing it was a really nice experience. You can tell that their planes are young, seats are comfortable and ICE is really good, so many movies and you got nice headphones even in economy. Food on board was good, I liked the taste and was actually full. On my flight from Vienna to Dubai, it took almost 2 hours to serve the food and since it was a 6 hour night flight you want to sleep, however, on my second flight it was better. Price was really good, it was the second cheapest ticket I found. We had long layover in Dubai (on purpose because we wanted to see Dubai) where we were given a meal voucher for Dubai airport for a couple of restaurants which was really nice. I will definetelly fly with them again, already purchased tickets to Bali and plan other destinations this year as well.",7,3rd March 2016,Czech Republic
1431,"Kuwait to Kuala Lumpur via Dubai with Emirates - a pleasant experience. I was overfed (which is a pro in my opinion), the seats were comfortable, the ICE system was amazing and helped pass the time, and overall the crew were amazing. I would definitely fly Emirates again in the future.",10,1st March 2016,Kuwait
1432,"Chauffeur pick up worked excellently, and is a really nice touch. The lounge at Birmingham was fairly small but large enough for the number of passengers and with good food and drink. The Birmingham to Dubai leg was on an old 777, and the 777 business product isn't as good as the product on other airlines for this length flight. The seats aren't fully flat nor do they have direct aisle access. As this was also an old plane the in flight entertainment was fairly poor. While the screen was enormous, the resolution was very low and the controls were frustratingly difficult. The cabin crew were fine without being outstandanding as was the food. The lounge at Dubai was very good as we were in a smaller one rather than the main central one. The food and drink offering was very good and I liked that some of the bar was self service. Dubai to Mumbai was on a newer 777 and the entertainment was much better. As this was a short flight through the night there is not too much to say, although the cabin crew were fairly good, they did insist on waking up passengers who had ordered food then clearly changed their mind and fallen asleep (it was 4am). Spending a long time trying to wake them up, not just a quick tap or hello. Arriving in Mumbai was fairly easy with prompt processing on the ground. The chauffeur pick up worked well although could have been better organised at the airport itself as you just had to look around the busy bundle of Emirates chauffeurs trying to find your name. A central person who located your driver would make it much smoother and more professional.",9,1st March 2016,United Kingdom
1433,"Mumbai to Gatwick via Dubai with Emirates. Chauffeur pick up and check in/security at Mumbai went smoothly. The lounge is a shared one at Mumbai but nice and the staff excellent. Mumbai to Dubai was on an old 777 but was suitable for this length flight. The seat is comfortable and spacious, and the IFE screen of reasonable resolution and had a good selection. Food was fine. The lounge at Dubai is not a particularly good one in my opinion as it is huge and chaotic and not a particularly nice layout. I appreciate this is only business not first, but still would have preferred less of a corridor feel to it, as well as self service drinks areas dotted about. Dubai to Gatwick leg was excellent. The superior level of the seat is significant and avod is excellent. The cabin crew on this flight were friendly and attentive. The only very minor niggle is that the food and wine service were not coordinated at all, so the wine was served after the meal rather than with it. This was after two glasses of champagne and a gin and tonic though so no real complaint. The big let down was Gatwick airport where we were not offered premium service for immigration. Gatwick is awful at the moment and the queue was enormous. This as well as the ridiculous and terribly organised baggage reclaim (which clearly is not able cope with the A380) let down the whole premium experience of Emirates down.",3,1st March 2016,United Kingdom
1434,"Sydney to Dubai with Emirates. We were allocated the wrong seats from check-in. Ended sitting next to an inebriated passenger that made the trip the worst. Tried to change the seats before the flight but the ground staff were very rude. On return complained to airline, but not even an apology.  The customer service team is a computer. The only response I got was a computer generated letter. ",10,1st March 2016,Australia
1435,"Booked to fly from New Delhi to Accra via Dubai in business class with Emirates in Aug 2015 with a layover of 1 hr 20 mins in Dubai. The flight from Delhi took off 30 mins late and then circled Dubai before landing in a remote corner of the airport. We rushed and reached our boarding gate (20 mins before departure) just as the last of the economy passengers were boarding. We were denied boarding on the pretext that we were late at the gate - never mind that there was no one to receive us at the terminal, Emirates flight from Delhi was late and that last few passengers were still boarding right in front of us. Staff at the gate were rude, turned us away and asked us to get our re-routing from the Emirates customer service. With 2 kids who were sleepy and exhausted, we made our way to a long queue at the customer service counter. They routed us to Accra via Abuja and on my husbands persistent query assured us that Abuja had transit facilities. The situation in Abuja was far from this - no transit, we were made to collect our bags by paying for passenger trolleys, re-check in at Arik Air and fight customs / immigration who insisted on stamping our passports. The Arik Air flight was delayed, there was no business class lounge at the airport and the flight itself was a small propeller aircraft. We were happy to reach Accra in one piece after the harrowing experience. On registering a complaint with Emirates we were advised that they would investigate and needed 30 days - at the end of this period they came back with no admittance of guilt but offered us 15,000 frequent flyer points each which to date they have not credited to my children's account. Contrast this with our recent experience on Eithopian where we were transported from the tarmac when they were late on a flight from ACC to NBO and even connected our bags. Did not expect Emirates to treat business class passengers in this manner. They clearly are now such a big airline that they could not be bothered by these exceptions - imagine how they treat non-gold, economy class travelers - am glad to see other airlines now catching up with them.",7,29th February 2016,Ghana
1436,"Dallas to Dubai with Emirates - amazing airline. A380 with good service, tasty food. The seat comfort was good. The cabin crew are friendly, entertainment had some good games and the latest movies to watch. The personal video screen size was good. Every 4 hours they serve a meal or snack. You can also get get free drinks any time in the flight. Every 1 hour they come along with some juice and some refreshments. Ground service was nice, little busy but overall good.",8,29th February 2016,United States
1437,"So the boarding was chaotic. Not much. The crew distributed hot towel in other section but not ours.  The ICE system had an amazing variety of movies, shows, music etc. Once in air crew immediately distributed the food and drink. Pillow and headphones with magazines and.  The serving of food just had 1 choice. Well it was fine for a short haul flight. The flight was of 1.30 hours. The food was fine not bad and drink was average. Not much variety. The landing was good. Crew were also good.",8,28th February 2016,Pakistan
1438,We were very pleased in all respects with Emirates. The check in both in Gatwick and Dubai was swift and efficient. On board the seating was fine with plenty of leg room and the meals served were tasty. The best aspect is the in flight entertainment system which has a huge variety of films and TV and large screens to make viewing a pleasure and cameras on the plane so you can watch the take off and landing from the pilot's view. I even read my emails using on-board wifi. It's a million miles away from British Airways! I would not hesitate to fly with Emirates again.,9,26th February 2016,United Kingdom
1439,"Mumbai to Dubai and Emirates staff was very considerate. I was travelling with a active toddler. Dubai to San Francisco and the air hostess are least bothered. Not a sight of smile while welcoming. Young kids needs milk, is it not obvious or let parents carry them. Irony is they ran out of milk when asked for second time. In a 15 hour flight is it not reasonable for a parent to ask another serving of milk for toddler. I guess cabin crew staff needs to be trained to handle young kids and learn some patience instead of making faces. This is annoying for passengers.",10,26th February 2016,United States
1440,"From the moment I checked in, Emirates managed to make a mess of things. I asked the agent at the check in counter if I could use the lounge with my One World emerald status (Platinum with Qatar Airways), given that QF and EK code share the flight I was checking in for. She took my card then mistakenly entered the membership number with QF instead of QR. I didn't notice her error until I arrived at the QF lounge and was promptly denied entry. EK also switched my seat without informing me. When I asked about it at the gate, I was told that there was a note in the record that my seat had been changed in order to allow a family to sit together. That is fine, but EK could have at least had the courtesy to inform me at check in. Onboard, FAs did the minimum. I asked for a bandage for a small cut on my finger which the FA completely forgot about. The best was when I asked for ketchup to accompany my breakfast of hash browns and a frittata - exactly the sort of dishes one would eat with ketchup. I was informed that ketchup is only available in business and first class. What? Is ketchup the new Dom Perignon? Give me a break. Requests with the call button went ignored. Last time I flew with EK was in business class from NBO-KWI via DXB. I didn't find it to be a very good experience. The final kicker is they broke a wheel of my dependable and well constructed roll on bag. ",6,25th February 2016,United States
1441,"My husband and I enjoyed our outbound Emirates flight from San Francisco to Dubai to Bangalore. No problems there. However, on our way back I was given a seat that doesn't recline (Dubai to San Francisco) and for a 15 hour flight, my back was toast. I have a bad back.  I mentioned it to the stewardess and she tried to fix/push the button for the recliner, to no avail. She however tried to put me in another vacant seat, but I declined because I don't want to leave my husband by himself.",4,22nd February 2016,United States
1442,"Hamburg to Bangkok via Dubai. Different service experiences. Flight HAM-DXB (EK 60) was on time, First was fully booked. Very good service by 2 attentive FA's and the purser. Wines were outstanding, 40 year old Port, excellent Cognac. Emirates First class food is a bit boring compared to Singapore Airlines and others where you can book your main course in advance. The second leg (EK 384 with A380) was a bad experience. Before take off in DXB I ordered my shower to have it 1.5hrs before landing. I was woken up very rudely by a female FA (she knocked loud on the door of my suite - on all flights before the FA's opened the door and woke up smoothly) and led me to the shower room. Normally in the meantime the FA's clean the suite and change the bed into a seat. When I came back after 20 minutes, nothing had happened, so I called the FA. Unwillingly she did their job and went away. Normally after having the shower the passenger were asked for their breakfast order. My FA was chatting with another pax and when some minutes later I called her and asked for breakfast she looked at her watch and told me, that in about 10 to 15 minutes we would start the descent and she could not serve me. I now asked for the purser and a little later I got my breakfast. The purser later came to me and apologized and told me, that he is not very happy that Emirates needs so much new staff and that today after too short a time FA's can serve in First Class. For me Emirates offers outstanding liquor and wines, the suites and showers are wonderful but it is a lucky draw, what kind of service you can expect in First class. They are growing too fast.",7,22nd February 2016,Germany
1443,"I easily redeemed my Emirates skywards points on the their website for a 2.5 hour return ticket from Bangkok - Hong Kong. I travelled on a brand new A380 with terrific new TV screens and new headphones with great sound. The screens are so large that the shape of the seats need to be angled to accomodate them. Check in, seat comfort, ICE entertainment, crew service and food was perfect - definately my airline of choice.",5,20th February 2016,Thailand

When we went from Birmingham, at the desk the ladies who let luggage go though were really friendly, as 1 of our bags had gone over the luggage allowance but they still let it go through. Sitting in the plane was really exciting for my son, and the area around our seats was clean. Cabin staff was so welcoming and helpful, they gave lots of refreshments throughout the journey and and were very attentive. Overall we had a brilliant experience with Emirates.",10,18th February 2016,United Kingdom
1446,"Manchester to Dubai return, and I was looking forward to my first flights with Emirates. On the way out from Manchester they switched the seats I booked 3 months ago - they gave me various reasons like different aircraft - not true - and eventually they moved me nearer to the seats I had booked - why was someone else sitting in the seats I had booked? In an 8 hour flight we had one drinks service and one meal - not enough. On the flight back they switched the seats I booked 3 months earlier - sounds familiar - same excuses - again not true - after stamping my feet they gave me the seats I had already booked. Meals were great but far between, drinks were almost non existent. Not the experience I was expecting. Good legroom, good food, excellent entertainment, but poor service. Living off their reputation I think.",8,18th February 2016,United Kingdom
1447,I was flying Emirates back to Kuwait in Economy Class from Mumbai post minor surgery. There was a long queue at the online check-in counter and therefore approached the Duty Manager to facilitate expedited check-in for medical reasons. I was almost immediately guided to the Business Class counter and was through in minutes. Boarding was smooth and almost on time. Aircrafts (B777) throughout the itinerary looked tired with none having Wide Screen IFE. On Board services were good with cabin crew attentive throughout the flight. Fare was possibly the lowest in spite of last minute booking. Great value for money. Quality and services can be attributed comprehensively on request or when having an issue. Will continue to fly with Emirates as I have been for the past decade or so especially considering the courtesy extended at check-in.,6,16th February 2016,Kuwait
1448,"Flew Dubai to Bangkok with Emirates. Second part of a long flight, seated in front cabin of economy class. Good unobtrusive service which helped the cabin stay quiet. Offered cold drinks several times and food was good. Cabin was full and space was at a premium especially in luggage bins, this may be due to people bring on two or three bags. Good entertainment on ICE service. Toilets freshened during the flight.",9,15th February 2016,United Kingdom
1449,Madrid to Dubai with Emirates. Sat in front cabin of economy row 42. One problem of this row is that because of the curve of the plane the overhead luggage compartment is smaller and normal wheeled cabin bags do not fit in them so bags have to be put further back. Reasonable leg room and very good service from stewards. As the flight was not full we were advised to go to the rear of the plane as there was lots of space there. Excellent selection of entertainment to enjoy. The front cabin is quiet. Ordered special meals and these were delivered promptly and were very good.,1,15th February 2016,United Kingdom
1450,"In December last year I flew Business Class with Emirates from Brisbane to London with my daughter, her husband and three children - a three year old and twelve month old twins. I knew this was not going to be easy, but in my worst imaginings I hadn't dreamt it would be such a nightmare. Let me apologise to our fellow passengers if they suffered on our account. The babies were booked on bassinet seats with their parents, but were too big to be able to use them. I was a few rows back with the 3 year old, but shared baby duties through the night. Right from before take-off, I could see we were not welcome. As the attendant near me gave the safety demonstration, one of our babies whimpered a little. She rolled her eyes and groaned at the prospect of the voyage ahead. Even with the comfort of lie-down seats, it was very difficult to keep the little ones asleep. So we would take them to the bar area so they could crawl around a bit without disturbing too many people. On two occasions when I was their with our little twin with cerebral palsy, her fingers were stepped on by the same hostess who had made us feel so unwelcome. Towards the end of the long flight to Dubai, we were all exhausted, but not once was there any offer of relief or assistance from the attendants who were standing around chatting amongst themselves. The seventy-two year old granny must have looked a fright as I walked in circles trying to lull the baby off to sleep! Believe it or not, the next leg of the journey was worse, as the seats I was in with the three year old would not recline. On two occasions I sought help. The attendant said she would 'reset' the equipment. This meant the video system also went off for 15 minutes, much to the distress of my little autistic grandson! I didn't see this attendant again. His seat did recline after this, but mine still did not! I tried again - different attendant - same story! I was forced to sit bolt upright all the way. Having outlaid almost $10,000 for Business Class, I was not happy! I would probably have been more comfortable in Economy! I would have thought that an Airline that advertises a high quality experience should be able to do better. They would have known our party was coming on board. One would have thought that for the sake of the other passengers the staff might have offered to help. Emirates always boast about how many different countries the attendants come from. Perhaps they would do better to choose staff with a bit more empathy towards their passengers instead!",3,15th February 2016,Australia
1451,"Phuket to Amsterdam via Dubai. A less interested crew than my outbound flights, but still efficient and friendly. On all 4 legs we arrived early. Food and beverages of great standard. Lounge in HKT not the best but you are escorted from check-in to the lounge and avoid horrendous queues at all stages of security. We arrived at a quiet time in DXB and the staff in the lounge were proactive, refilling drinks. A380 on DXB-AMS leg empty in Business Class which made the bar experience less fun but still a great trip. ",10,14th February 2016,Spain

1453,"London Heathrow to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok with Emirates. We were not offered enough water and when we asked staff for water it was a constant battle to get any, yet they were more than happy to give the drunk man constant alcoholic drinks and encourage him. The seat wouldn't recline and TV wouldn't work.  We asked staff for support and were told they would come back yet they didn't! We paid extra and specifically chose to fly with Emirates, a decision we can never take back. A once in a lifetime holiday started off awfully. One of our meal choices was chicken or beef and after asking for two beef were told only one left - en they went to the two rows behind us and offered beef or chicken. A complaint submitted and would hear within 30 days - 29 days later we got a reply, what a joke for an award winning service.",9,9th February 2016,United Kingdom

Obviously passengers expected some breakfast after takeoff but when the breakfast arrived I did not see anyone eating it because what was served was stale.  I am surprised why even the airline bothers to serve any food on this sector if there is nobody to check on what is being served. For an  airline like Emirates I expect a better standard than other airlines. The connecting flight to Frankfurt was at 8.40 on the A380 and I was pleasantly surprised on the good service by the cabin crew, as well as good food.",4,8th February 2016,Germany
1455,Emirates Amsterdam to Phuket AMS-DXB on brand new A380 just a few weeks in service and a great crew in Business Class. No Emirates lounge at AMS so took the 35 euro voucher for food and drink airside each instead of using the shared lounge. Great food and drink and early arrival with fast-track. Indeed we were in the complementary chauffeur before the STA of the flight arrival. Everything was well organised. Return chauffeur at DXB on time and another good flight to HKT on a much older 777 but again friendly crew who really wanted to be there. After some negative reviews we were concerned that Emirates had grown too fast and had deteriorated but this was not our experience and we would highly recommend.,2,7th February 2016,Spain
1456,"Munich to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. Slow and bad Business Class Service. The first drink on MUC-DXB and DXB-PER took ages. Don't ask for a refill - you won't get if because the cabin crew is not able and/or not willing to cope with extra requests. Particularly bad was the meal service on the DXB-PER leg. Food came without any drinks - not even water. When I used the call button a flight attendant showed up after a while and took my order. However, the order never arrived. She came back after - believe it or not - about 30 minutes and explained that thy have not been able to serve my order because ""they were busy with serving the food"". This is ridiculous given the fact that they have a large number of flight attendants in Business Class. Emirates might have a young fleet of aircraft, but their in-flight processes are a disaster and they have no service attitude. They are entirely inefficient. I can only recommend to use the Asian carriers or maybe Qatar Airways when you fly between Europe and Australia.",7,4th February 2016,Germany
1457,"We flew Emirates from Madrid to Dubai and we were shocked that the 777-300 was configured 3-4-3 on this aircraft and not the standard 3-3-3 as usually found on other airlines who operate the type, this, along with extrememly tight seat pitch made for a very uncomfortable flight. Ground service was good, no delays, no baggage problems and the IFE is excellent. Cabin crew seemed scattered and uncoordinated, the men do the donkey work whilst most of the girls seem to have been chosen for their looks rather than their ability to do the job. Dinner was served over two hours into the flight, ie, almost midnight, reasonable grilled chicken and bean salad starter followed by a choice of roast chicken or ragout of lamb. By the time they got to us they'd run out of the lamb, hardly surprising, so we got chicken for our main course too: dry as a bone, served with some sloppy veg. Breakfast wasn't offered, not even juice, just a choice of coffee or tea. One drinks service before dinner. A huge disappointment after all the hype we'd heard about Emirates. We'll see how next week's return flight goes.",7,4th February 2016,Spain
1458,"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The check in was good. Lounge was okay if very full, and the absence of flight boards was inexplicable in an airline-dedicated lounge. The food and drink adequate/above average for a small lounge. Boarding was prompt but only because I ignored the staff in the lounge and headed to the gate before the flight was called. I was amongst the first into the cabin but the rest of the Business passengers in the long missed priority boarding, which would have been inconvenient as within a few minutes the economy passengers were queuing through Business. Onboard the Business cabin felt cramped. The 2-3-2 configuration left little room for manoeuvre. There is no sense of privacy and aisle access is poor for many. The overhead locker over my seat was full of spare towels so I had to use another. Virtually no storage space around the seat other than a hole for shoes that was too small to take both of my (average sized) shoes and a front pocket on the back of the seat in front. IFE selection was adequate. Screen was large but situated in the back of the seat in front so the touch screen capability was redundant as it was well out of reach. Oddly there is no feature which stops it being seen from any angle, so in a D seat such as mine I could easily see 7 or 8 other screens. Not great if you have young children as they will perhaps see things you would prefer them not to. Also not great if the person beside you is watching the same movie as you - but has started it earlier. Complicated mini touch screen and separate controller system were not intuitive. I found the seat uncomfortable. Poorly situated armrests were at different levels and the internal one was too small. Very limited position options. The seat does not go fully flat nor to 180 degrees and when lying down I could not stretch out fully - and I am 175cm/5ft 9 inches tall. For me the key issue is the seat and so on this aspect alone I would not normally fly Emirates. The power port is recessed so that it cannot take an iPad or MacBook charger as there is insufficient room. Service was slow, an hour and 15 minutes after takeoff no drinks had been served, this on an overnight flight of 9 hours scheduled duration. Food arrived almost 2 hours after takeoff. It was OK but no more than that. The table is a good size and presentation was good. Service generally was not great. I asked for a second drink and it did not arrive after 10 minutes. Similarly I asked for earplugs from a different attendant which again did not arrive. The complimentary Bulgari washbag is large but contains unnecessary items such as large aftershave bottles - but no earplugs! There were only two toilets for 42 passengers. Definitely insufficient, it only took one person to be 5 mins plus for a long queue to build. The flight attendant apologized and told me that it was always like that. Flight arrived on time. Summary. The product feels like it is at least 10 years out of date. The main issue is the seat and configuration. Well below a Cathay, Qantas, Singapore, JAL or even BA. I understand that the A380 fitout may be better but I'll continue to avoid Emirates.",10,31st January 2016,United Kingdom
1459,"Copenhagen to Perth via Dubai with Emirates. The seat comfort on business class A380 was astounding. The seats on the CPH to DXB flight were more modern than Dubai to Perth, but both were just as comfortable. There was no Emirates lounge in Copenhagen, an Aviators lounge which was pretty good. The cabin staff was great on both flights, as was the food. The inflight entertainment was not lagging at all.

The 777 business class seats are outdated and other airlines have much better seating. Food and service was below average. Dubai to Sydney in an A380, crew were friendly but could not seem to get it together. I was travelling with a partner and food only came to one of us and not together, every single time my food orders were incorrect. Meals are getting smaller and are the same on other routes. Meals were served and wines were poured after meals ended. Comfort wise I was able to get some sleep in the A380 seats. Overall a below average experience with Emirates.",5,28th January 2016,Australia
1462,"Emirates once more offered a fantastic product, to bring me from Dubai to Frankfurt. The experience started with this unique Emirates chauffeur-Service, dropping me off at Dubai airport, just some steps away from a smooth check-in. Security and passport-control were easy and the lounge outstanding. It is huge, more like a First Class Terminal. It is important to keep in mind, that the airport is quite big, it took 15 minutes to walk from Check-in to the lounge and 15 minutes from the lounge to the gate. Boarding was well organized and efficient. This time, there was no airbridge to the upper deck, but this was not a problem, as the A380 was not fully booked. Priority boarding made it easy to get on the aircraft. Service was outstanding and the crew great, cheerful and friendly. Even when you did not have a meal at the lounge, it is nearly impossible to taste all the delices of the menu. Meal service is on demand, whenever you want it. Comfort is excellent, not only because of the shower and the seat/bed. This aircraft is so quiet! Onboard Wifi worked well during 2/3 of the flight, 500 MB for 1 USD is a fair deal. At Frankfurt, priority delivery of luggage (own belt for First an Business) worked well and with a waiting chauffeur-service, the way home was as easy as it could get. The not really cheap price was nevertheless more than ok for a high-end travel-experience with this unique bling-bling-feeling.",9,28th January 2016,Germany
1463,"Melbourne to Auckland with Emirates. 30-45 minutes late in takeoff, they said it was due to cleaners, anyway eventually we were allowed to board. The plane was nice, the seats looked comfortable enough and it was certainly clean. The FA's however were conspicuous in their absence. Once boarded, we didn't see them again till we were served a meal. About an hour or so before we landed I asked one FA about landing cards to fill in. She said they had run out of them as they ""never give us enough"" and we would probably have to fill in once we landed however to her credit she called around and found a pile more. Not sure why this wasn't done when they had run out earlier? Anyway that was sorted. They also asked for coin donations to a children's fund, so we had our coins ready but no one came for them. Just odd. The PE was quite good though but as for service, I'd say below par compared to most airlines I have flown.",8,27th January 2016,Australia

The cabin crew seemed disinterested and more busy with themselves than with their passengers. Two crew doing the meal serving were gossiping about a colleague apparently oblivious to the fact that at least 20 pax around them where hearing this.

I phoned the local Emirates office and spent 56 minutes on the phone to try and fix this at my own cost. We were offered a refund, but at this late notice we would not have found affordable alternatives. The first option I was given was to go via Houston and miss my connecting flight from Panama to Quito. The second option was via Sao Paulo. My original flight landed at 16:40 on 4 March. I had booked accommodation in Panama for the night of the 4th to recover from the longest flight in the world. My new flight lands at 6:49am on 5 March. I will now be spending two nights travelling including a layover from 6pm to 2am in the São Paulo airport. I was not offered any options to make this less horrible. I was not offered an upgrade on one of the legs or access to a lounge in Sao Paulo. In addition, it was only explained to me after I had agreed to this route change that the flight from Sao Paulo to Panama will be with Copa Airlines - not Emirates. As we are travelling with surfboards, this will cost us money. I wrote a complaint to Emirates and received an email stating that on cases such as these, they are unable to offer lounge access or an upgrade.

The crew looks at you and says yes, but then they disappear so you have to ask another crew member - and if you are lucky, the third or the fourth one will finally get you what you want! It's such a shame that inflight service is mirroring so bad on the airline. Yes the flights are long and you get tired but you know this when you apply for this job.

The entertinment was OK but headphone socket was dodgy so only had sound in one ear. Landed on time in Dubai but the queues for security were horrendous. Easy transfer to A terminal and the flight on a newer A380 took off about 30 minutes late. Again, trolley service was vey slow and cabin crew seemed to do a poor job. As this was a 3am departure only a sandwich and drink was served before the lights went out. Prior to landing in Hong Kong a hot breakfast was served which was OK. Scrambled egg, baked beans, spinach, veg hash brown. Immigration at HKG took forever then had to wait ages for bags to be delivered to the carousel.

1470,"Kuala Lumpur to Heathrow via Dubai, and returning from London Gatwick through Dubai with Emirates, in economy. I am very impressed with the experience on each flight I took. There were no major delays to speak of, the food was actually very good (minus the strange fishy starters), drinks were plentiful and they had a great database of entertainment. The tail mounted cameras are a fantastic feature and the wifi worked well - but only on 2 of the flights. The crew couldn't do enough to help, they were friendly and helpful it was refreshing compared to some airlines I have been on. One downside I found on all flights was that it took over an hour for the FAs to get the drinks trollies and begin service. Each time they started serving from the front of the cabin, which for me was fine as I was at the front - while the people in the back looked on longingly. The check-in staff at Gatwick were really miserable. Other than that, everything was perfect. The first of four legs was on the Boeing 777-300ER with 10 abreast seating. Yes the aisles are a little narrow but as there was nobody next to me it wasn't a problem. I'm 5'11 and 70kg - sat in the aisle seat and wasn't hit very often. Maybe a larger person may feel more uncomfortable, especially if the middle seat were occupied. The other 3 legs on the A380 were better. The seats were roomy and spacious, and on the DXB - KUL route the plane was 10 days old. The flight was empty and there were only about 12 people in a cabin of 120(ish) seats so the crew and I spent half the flight talking as there was little for them to do. 68A was a great seat as it has nobody in front.

1471,"Melbourne to Kuala Lumpur with Emirates, and I arrived on New Years Day in Kuala Lumpur to discover that my wallet had fallen out of my carry on bag, and the first thing I did on entering the airport was look for it. Staff were unhelpful and the ground crew refused to let me back on the plane to check. I understand this may be policy but nothing was explained.  After waiting to no avail I went to collect my luggage, but to my horror no luggage appeared. The staff representing Emirates had no help or a kind word to offer, and could not tell me where my bags were. The best I could do was make my way to my hotel and wait. My bags turned up the following day. On my return flight, accompanied by my partner, we found that they had changed our pre-selected seats and we were not seated together. We did not notice this until we were through immigration, and then had to talk our way back through so that we could convince the check-in desk to re-seat us -  a huge waste of time. Waiting for our luggage at Melbourne airport at 2:00am it turned out they had misplaced my luggage again, as well as my partners this time. This led to more time spent at the lost baggage counter, and having to sit at home for the better part of the next day waiting for it to be delivered. All up I would say that I wasted at least 8 hours on unnecessary mistakes, not to mention the distress caused, which was certainly not alleviated by their very unhelpful staff.

1476,"Flew Durban to Seattle via Dubai on Emirates Boeing 777s. Durban to Dubai was very bumpy almost the entire 8 hours, so cabin service was limited to a single meal and a single drink prior to that meal. Cabin crew were fine, not overly friendly but definitely not hostile. The warm towels were a nice touch. Seat was a not terribly crowded aisle seat in row 41 made all the more comfortable by the fact that the person in front of me did not recline. Thank you! Inflight entertainment offerings were somewhat limited (just 400 channels) but far superior to SAA's offerings. Flight was very full in economy. Dubai to Seattle leg is a long ride: 13 hours over Iran, Russia and the north pole. Cabin service again was very good. The meal was ok; a promising chicken dish in a mustard sauce that lacked flavor when delivered but the rest of the meal was quite good. Cabin crew offered pizza a couple of hours before landing.  I was seated in a window seat on this leg which felt more crowded because I had people next to me and the guy seated in front of me reclined to the max as soon as he could and stayed that way the entire flight! IFE on this leg (ICE) was outstanding, over 1000 different selections including several Mozart channels plus a whole season of The Big Bang Theory! Plane was very full in economy. Overall, a pretty good experience for such a long ride. Booked 14 days in advance and still got what I consider to be a great price considering the distance and how full the plane was when I booked. If you're not a high-maintenance customer, Emirates value to its passengers is definitely superior to South African Airways.",3,17th January 2016,United States
1477,"Hong Kong to Glasgow via Dubai with Emirates. The bar was a highlight of the first leg of my flight. The food on Emirates lacks a certain something. Not sure what it is but the menu just doesn't seem inspiring. Beverages on the other hand are plentiful, varied and excellent. My seat on the A380 was comfortable but I feel boxed in on those seats. The one on the 777 was a pain in the butt. I wanted to do some work on the plane but my lights shone into the face of the person seated beside me on the 777. My personal reading light did not work at all. Further to this, the lounge in Dubai is not a pleasant relaxing environment. There are just too many people running around. Not great at 3am when all you want is a good rest. I ended up going down to my gate where everyone was a lot less manic and chilled out on the comfortable long loungers. The chauffeur service was excellent, my driver going above and beyond the call of duty to deliver a great service in Glasgow. My return flight was the contentious one. I'd chosen my seat when booking, an aisle seat because I'm very tall - when I went online to check in, I find my seat has been re-allocated without even being informed. Not an obligation on their part of course but it would be nice to know. Ended up upgrading to business rather than deal with middle seat in economy. In a rare act for one so afraid of flying as myself, I managed to focus on the entertainment for more than ten minutes without losing myself to panic. Managed to watch live football which was a great and pleasant surprise! As it goes, the one leg of economy I had, seated near the front of the bottom deck in economy was the most comfortable and best flight of my itinerary. Great seat.",10,14th January 2016,Hong Kong
1478,"Auckland to Newcastle via Dubai and I was very disappointed with the service. They had run out of food options so we only had one choice, the staff were unhelpful. My coffee fell off my tray onto my seat, I told the stewardess and she handed me five napkins and walked away. I asked her for another blanket and she never returned, so I asked another stewardess and she walked away. I thought she was coming back so I was reluctant to fall asleep, I sat on my soaked blanket to soak up the coffee on the chair. Half an hour later she didn't return so I had to ask a third member of the crew. The crew were rude about getting the trolleys past us and when they hit a man's foot they didn't apologise. They looked stressed and annoyed during the flight safety announcement. When they brought round the warm towels the stewardess handed one to the person next to me then noticed she had none left to give me. She said ""oh"" and walked away. When another steward came to collect our towels I said I never received one and he frowned, looked around, and walked away. I wasn't spoken to again. Halfway through the flight an alarm went off and a yellow light flashed the stewardesses asked each other ""what does that mean"". I pointed to the screen by the toilets where it said ""smoke detected"". They swore and ran off and came back later to announce ""it was just someone's deodorant"".  Finally we were delayed for an hour when leaving Dubai and were not informed why or spoken to, we just watched the flight safety video and an hour later we suddenly took off. ",7,12th January 2016,United Kingdom
1479,"The London-Dubai leg was great because we got an Emirates A380 and it was generally a comfortable experience with minimal bumps. The service was also exceptional with the attendants appearing warm and friendly while the food was decent. The leg from Dubai to Kuala Lumpur was a whole different story. The plane felt old and gaudy. For 4 hours of a 6 hour journey, we were subjected to so much turbulence that it made it terribly difficult to do anything. Nobody could go to the bathroom too and so I spent 4 hours having to hold my bladder in. The passengers lose all sense of comfort and peace of mind when we have to experience a heavily bumpy journey for a protracted period of time. I was assigned seat 21H due to its accessibility to the bathroom. If anyone chooses this seat, I promise you that you would be subjected to people's butts brushing against your arm for the entire flight. I've had the flight attendants rush past me hitting my arm repeatedly without ever apologizing.  They would grab your food trays without asking too. The attendants on the A380 were much more polite and pleasant.  Their airline ranking must have gone to their heads. ",7,12th January 2016,United Kingdom
1480,"Nightmare Emirates flight from Dubai to London. We were on our 2nd leg of our journey from Sri Lanka to UK on 5th January. First the flight was delayed from 4.10 to 5.00. Then 45 mins into the flight we were informed by the Captain that there was a problem with the undercarriage and we would be turning back to Dubai. After dumping fuel and circling for a further 2 hrs in Dubai, we landed back in Dubai at 9.00pm. Then we had to wait in a queue with just 2 people at the counter to get docs to go to a Hotel. It was taking for ever. After collecting docs they were asked to go to yet another counter to leave the duty free items bought. It was utter chaos, children were crying, there were a lot of very tired passengers. Finally after a very long time and the Management woke up to the crisis, they offered food and the business lounge for some of the passengers, which we took up. I am totally shocked at the Emirates response to this incident. No regard to the passengers and what they had gone thru. They had over 3 hrs to organise the vouchers for the Hotels and transport for the passengers. Yet they kept passengers waiting longer with their laidback attitude. Will certainly be thinking twice before booking Emirates again!",5,10th January 2016,United Kingdom
1481,"New York to Dubai. After having flown with various American airlines over the last 8 months I’m relieved to be back on Emirates. The first class on the A380 is everything it should be. Love the privacy of their suite and comfort of the seat, may it be in an upright position, lounge or as a fully flat bed with a separate mattress which is excellent for sleeping. The catering is on-demand, with an amazing selection of food. I tend to over-eat on such flights for I’m eager to try everything. And drink everything. I wasn’t disappointed. Everything I tried was top notch quality and taste. IFE is incredible with an amazing collection of movies and TV shows. And the 32-inch screen is a pleasure to watch. The piece-de-resistance is the shower that sets them apart. The surprisingly disappointing feature on this flight was their internet. Given how heavily they promote online connectivity while flying and the free (or nearly free) service, it is also a frustratingly slow experience. This is something that needs to improve. I simply gave up for the connection was so slow. ",7,9th January 2016,Singapore
1482,"Rome to Jakarta via Dubai with Emirates, and terrible in-flight service. Was calling for a flight attendant to help pull the screen from the side of my seat and had to wait for at least 30 minutes before one showed up and that was for the inflight meal service. Then she just stared at me and did not move a muscle until I requested her to help pull out the tv screen. Without waiting for any of us to pull out our tray table, the flight attendant just distributed the lunch trays and they were on our laps. Terrible! Despite asking for an aisle seat for both legs of my journey, I got a middle seat for the second leg of my journey. The ground crew behind the counter failed to tell me that I will get a middle seat as perhaps no other aisle seats were available. Food was so-so compared to a few other airlines I have taken over the years. Overall, I was quite disappointed with my experience, which happens to be my first time with Emirates.",3,8th January 2016,Indonesia
1483,"Durban to Birmingham via Dubai return. I have flown three times with Emirates in the past 6 months and been satisfied with the service. However, on the flight from Birmingham to Dubai on 29th December, the ICE system froze which didn't bother me very much. Coupled with that, however, was the fact that our seats could not be adjusted and we had to sleep in an almost upright position. This is not acceptable, particularly as I had paid a premium price for the flight, due to the festive season.",8,7th January 2016,South Africa
1484,"Glasgow to Tokyo Narita via Dubai with Emirates, and on both legs of my trip the seat and service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, however there were a few items to mention. The first was that at Dubai we had a 25 minute bus tour of the airport complex from the gate to reach the plane flying the second leg. No real inconvenience but it felt slightly odd to be on the bus driving around for so long. The second issue was with the food that was served on the Tokyo flight. I had the oriental vegetarian meal booked and I genuinely have no idea what the main portion of my meal was. I was served an odd flavorless mush that resembled wallpaper paste which I couldn't eat, so I had to abandon it and instead have some of the pastries the cabin crew brought round with the coffee. I'd recommend using the airline but to avoid choosing my food option!",8,6th January 2016,Japan
1485,"I have now flown return from Perth to London Heathrow via Dubai with Emirates on two separate occasions, and each trip has been poor. My expectations had been high which is perhaps why each trip has been a disappointment. I have encountered long delays in flight departures waiting on the tarmac on at least half of the legs flown as flights seem to seldom leave on time. The cabin staff are unfriendly and the entertainment selection is the worst I have encountered. You are hard pushed to find a film title you even recognize in the list of new releases. On two occasions my meal choice has been unavailable (despite being seating fairly close to the start of service) and obtaining a drink (water not alcohol) outside of the allocated service times is as if you have asked for the moon on a stick. Meal quality is however pretty good. Seats are generally comfortable and provide ample space for a long haul flight. I have only flown Emirates as Qantas does not operate its own flights out of Perth and I wish to maximize my QFF benefits by flying on a code share flight.",9,6th January 2016,Australia
1486,"London to Brisbane return via Dubai with Emirates, and our journey was the worst I have had. The crew were not service oriented and were rude - we waited 2.5 hours before we were offered water or a drink. I had stewardesses telling me ""no"" and ""I am too busy"" so many times. The crew gave the impression that they would rather be anywhere other than serving on that aircraft. Do not bother complaining - they seem to have no customer service team, but an email that will give you a generated standard reply. When I did more digging and calling, they admitted that they do not have a phone number or a team that I could speak to.",3,6th January 2016,United Kingdom
1487,"Mauritius to Dusseldorf via Dubai. The advantage of Emirates are quite modern aircraft with spacious seats, and attractive pricing for business class. The disadvantage is that you'll have an extra stop-over at Dubai. It looks like that Emirates puts more emphasis on languages spoken onboard by its crew, than the quality of their job performance. On two out of four flights on this vacation, I found that the crew assigned to my section were very professional. The other two flights the crew were sloppy or inadequately trained. On one flight I had to move to another seat because the headrest was broken. (I am quite tall person, and therefore a headrest that is so loose that it immediately drops to the lowest position, is not acceptable for me). When moving to an empty seat a stewardess told me that she had received several reports of seat problems on that flight. Because of the quality of the customer service of Emirates, my overall rating is low. It took one week to get a standard answer to one of the two issues I reported. This standard answer was obvious not applicable to my situation. I then asked for a relevant answer on both issue, but after an month I haven't received any answer at all. Especially for business and first class passengers I would have expected a functioning customer service department.",10,5th January 2016,Switzerland
1488,"Bangkok to Sydney with Emirates. The service was robotic at best. The seat was so narrow so much that the person next to me was basically sitting in my lap the entire trip, and legroom was barely enough. The food was very cluttered in choice and tasted bland. For a company that prides themselves on quality of food and service they should share that experience with the entire plane, not just business class.  The free WIFI was a bonus but at 10MB was hardly enough in the age of smartphones.",8,4th January 2016,Australia

In flight entertainment was good and the screen is really large, but the headsets are extremely bad. The food is acceptable, nothing exciting. Cabin staff was efficient and friendly. Seat selection was not available at the time of booking, even though I had paid for a full fare flexible ticket. This resulted in my partner and I being separated during the flight. For that reason, I will avoid flying with them in the future.",8,3rd January 2016,Singapore
1490,"Colombo to Copenhagen via Dubai return. Emirates advertise that a business class ticket include a hotel in Dubai when you travel through this city and that you pick up the voucher in the airport prior to embarkation. We booked online and at the same time reserved the hotels and received confirmation on the hotels as well as of travel tickets during the booking process. In Copenhagen on the way to Colombo this worked as advertised and we were able to break up the journey into two 5-6 hr flights by staying overnight in Dubai. However, on our return flight no voucher was receivable in Colombo and we were told to pick it up in Dubai. In Dubai we were sent from counter to counter in the very large airport and were finally told that no hotel voucher would be issued. The argument used was that although you book online you have to call the Emirate office afterwards to confirm the booking! Apparently this is written somewhere in the small print of the ""conditions for sale"". In other words you may book online but you can't rely on the confirmation received during booking but have to call the office anyway. So what is the point of having on-line bookings when the information is not valid anyway?",4,2nd January 2016,Denmark

1493,Durban to Manchester via Dubai. Very disappointing flight. I'm a frequent flyer and always had faith in Emirates but no more. Departed 28 December from Durban on flight EK776 to Dubai. The area around my seat smelled of urine. My tv screen hung loosely so I could not adjust the angle plus it was sticky to the touch. Cabin staff appeared stressed and smiles were absent. I accepted that sometimes stuff happens and maybe Emirates had experienced some hiccups that evening. However when I was served with a very stale soggy chicken bun and inedible old chocolate brownie I felt most disgruntled. Even economy flight tickets are expensive and I left that flight most unhappy.,2,31st December 2015,United Kingdom

1497,"This was the return sector of my trip. Check in was again hampered by business class passengers using the first class counter. The premium lane for immigration really made the airport experience easy. The lounge in Bangkok was excellent and food good, although there was no area seated for first class passengers. On board this time, again the seat was the highlight; personal bar and amenities highly appreciated. Food again was tasteless and disappointing. Cabin staff were friendly. The purser however was never seen, and as a first class passenger I expect to be made to feel a little more important to the airline especially as a frequent flyer member. I would have expected to be greeted by the purser. Announcements were mundane and without particular emphasis on polite service. In summary, my second sector in Emirates first class and all in all I must say, other than the seat which is great for long haul, a very average experience that could be so much better.",3,22nd December 2015,Hong Kong

The lounge in Hong Kong was adequate but busy with no separate area for first class passengers. Onboard, the seat is amazing with it's own bar and an ability to close yourself in the suite. Very good. My wife was in 4K however, and that was a noisy seat with a lot of galley noise, not really first class! Food was disappointing with overcooked chicken and half of the menu items not even offered. At no time was I offered cheese or chocolates which are on the menu. The lights in the shower suites were not working and the flight attendant opened the door once when my wife was in there using the toilet. Inflight entertainment was impressive, but the remote for my seat stopped working half way to Bangkok.

The food out of Gatwick was revolting but on other sectors was good especially the fish coming out of Mauritius. Found it odd that they serve food first and then come round with drinks as it means you've finished eating before you get a drink. The food needs to be hotter, mine was barely warm enough. The crew on the Boeing 777 coming back to LGW seemed more efficient and friendly than any of the A380 crews. The IFE is outstanding on Emirates, so much to choose from. The drawback for flying on Boeing 777 for me was having to be bussed to some remote stand at Dubai, it took ages to get to the plane. It seems that the A380's get the airbridges and the B777's have all been kicked out to the back of beyond. The low rating for WIFI is because I didn't use it.",9,21st December 2015,United Kingdom
1500,"My husband and I flew Emirates from Lusaka to Dubai, on the way to China during mid September. We are Platinum and Gold card holders respectively, and frequent fliers of Emirates on the Lusaka-Dubai route on Business class. We were upgraded from Business Class to First Class for this specific flight, and were appalled at the quality of the A340 Premium products. For all the wonderful advertisements (and personal experiences) on premium products on the A380s and B777s, the product on the LUN-DXB sector is something that definitely needs to change. Business Class seats themselves are not fully flat beds, only the old cradle seats, hence was pleased to be upgraded to First Class, but we weren't aware of what was coming. We got First Class seats where the recline and leg rests were not working. Hence was made to stand and wait 20 minutes in the aisle while the flight attendants tried to manually recline our seats. Although this was done, the leg rest was not able to be manually reclined, hence was given boxes, yes boxes and pillows in order to rest our legs. For one of the so called best airlines in the world, that is completely unacceptable. This is something that no one should experience on First class, especially if someone pays the very high fares Emirates offers. To make things worse, when complaining through email to Emirates, we got a response saying ""technical faults can develop at any point,"" implying that even if you pay more for a Business/First class seat, there is no guarantee that you will get a good seat on Emirates.",4,21st December 2015,Zambia

1502,"Flew Brisbane to Auckland return on Emirates A380's. We were delayed on the tarmac in Brisbane for the Brisbane - Auckland flight due to the power shutting down on the plane when taxiing back from the gate. The pilot said he had to reset some computer settings and then the power came back on. Then as we were taxiing, he stopped and advised that the water system wasn't working. So he was going to do some resetting on the tarmac to see if the computers could reset the water supply. After about an hour of this, he went back to the gate to have engineers look at it (another 45 mins or so) and finally we were on our way 2 hours late. It wasn't very comforting to hear the pilot not finish sentences on occasion when giving us updates - it was as though he drifted off! Also, my husband's headset was broken, he asked for a new one but unfortunately a new headset never arrived. If it had been a longer flight, he would have followed this up. The food was pretty cold due to the delay, and there was the rudest male cabin supervisor I've ever come across. I went to ask for some water from the galley (as after the service, the cabin crew do a pretty good job of disappearing to avoid being asked for service I guess). I was standing there for a few minutes and he knew it, and he never even asked how he could help. I had to ask him! He basically ignored me and was generally grumpy when and unsmiling when he did go up and down the aisle during the service. The way back was much better with friendlier cabin crew, a coherent pilot and a plane that had no issues apart from my headset jack not providing stereo this time. The food was fine this time too.

Given that we were flying over the North Pole on the first leg, I can understand it, but it is still something Emirates should work on for the long haul flights. The leg from DXB to JNB was on a 777. Not as nice as the A380, but still great. They woke us up to feed us, which I thought was a nice touch, although I could see some people not liking it. I think the biggest problem with Emirates business class is that there's really no need to fly first class. The Business Class experience was better than the First Class trips I've had.

I was told that there was nothing left, ""everything has been demolished"" I was told by a steward. Whilst I understand the limitations of food on board, I would expect something small to snack on for a flight of this length. Eventually, after saying how astounded I was, one of the stewards said they knew where a stash could be found! Why was it not readily available anyway? He gave me two small packets. Worse still, every cup of coffee I had was lukewarm so I asked for tea, that was worse, it looked like dish water, the colour was not tea!

Arrival was on time as scheduled. A380 a joy to travel in. What could be better is if the departure gate in Dubai allows for 2 level entries, as premium passengers were boarded through the lower entry door, which could be problematic for elderly passengers as they have to go up on a stairs to the business cabin. Male amenity kit bag has been shrunk which is good. The content remains the same. The service is good with crew members working hard. A minor tweak on the menu since the last time and improvement was noticed in this flight. Poach eggs served on the breakfast menu in this flight has improved since the last flight I took.  Wifi still not really working. Due to recent event in San Bernardino, I was held up at the LAX immigration, due to the origin of my travel was from an Arab country. After all the searches completed 5 hours later, I exited LAX and could not found the limousine driver.

1512,"Flew Emirates DXB-MAN, 07/12, afternoon flight on the A380. On boarding the aircraft we were greeted by miserable cabin crew so got the feeling it wasn't going to be a great flight and we were correct. The flight took off on time and it was a full flight so knew the service would be slow but waiting 90 minutes after take off for any refreshment is poor by Emirates standards. No pre dinner drink just the food and then another wait for drinks. Crew were surly and clearly didn't want to be at work that day. Asked for another drink to be grunted at by the stewardess who moaned she would have to write my drink down as a few people were asking. If they had been pro active and commenced a drinks service before the food maybe people wouldn't be asking for another drink so soon after the meal. Cabin crew then disappeared and not offered anything else until 2 hours before landing when they came round with afternoon tea. A very small sandwich and a tiny scone. The aircraft was immaculate as it was only 3 months old. Flight landed 40 minutes early. I would fly Emirates again but would avoid the A380 where possible.",7,12th December 2015,United Kingdom
1513,"We couldn't have asked for a better ending for a week long vacation in the UAE, as we flew back to India on an Emirates A380. I was glad that all the excitement paid off with this flight. EK500 operating on the DXB-BOM sector had already occupied its gate (B20), even before we cleared our formalities. The flight, needless to say is big and the number of people waiting to get on board is a clear sign of that. The cabin crew on board were polite and never dropped their smile throughout the flight duration. The legspace gets in more inches than a B777 (that we used for BOM-DXB) and the windows seem more larger. The night time ambient lighting adds to the drama with all the buttons overhead at the touch of a remote. The in-flight entertainment provides all the details of the flight and the most amazing outdoor camera locations one can ask for during the flight. The food was pretty good, if not exceptional and we were more than happy with the fact that it was piping hot. The cabin is very quiet once the Rolls Royce's are burnt at full throttle and you can hardly feel any vibrations. I would recommend everyone flying to Dubai to at least once experience their A380 aircrafts.",7,11th December 2015,India
1514,"I have been traveling Emirates since 2005 and have found that the inflight service has been going downhill over the past 2 years. On 9th December, I flew from Mumbai to Dar Es Salaam via Dubai. I was extremely disappointed with the staff attitude. I found that the table was dirty and had food and tea/coffee stains on it. I brought this to the attention of the staff and they were completely indifferent towards it. They gave me a wet tissue and asked me to clean it myself. On my next flight from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam my vegetarian meal was given away to another passenger.",7,11th December 2015,Tanzania
1515,"Paris CDG to Dubai. It was the first time we had flown with Emirates and we had a very easy trip. Staff pleasant, food good, flight on time. Seats comfortable. As it was a daytime flight we did not attempt to sleep but have no reason to think as a bed the seats would be as comfortable. A slightly strange layout in business class. Seems to be more directed at solo travellers.",5,10th December 2015,Australia
1516,"Our flight (EK507) got delayed by an hour and it left quite a sour experience at the start of our vacation.  The aircraft was well maintained and the crew were quite welcoming right from the door. The food served on board was of decent quality, but they ran out of the non-vegetarian course by the time the trolley reached my seat. We landed around 45 minutes after our schedulued arrival, and we missed our connecting bus (Emirates shuttle) to Abu Dhabi, as it left sharp at 7 PM. The surprising part about all this is that Emirates dont take any liability for missed bus connections, as it is apparently hosted by a 3rd party. I hope that in future Emirates do take this flaw in account, so as to make sure that passengers missing the bus connection due to a flight delay are not inconvinienced.",2,9th December 2015,India
1517,Karachi to New York via Dubai. Best flight I have experienced. The staff was very nice and cooperative. They have the best entertainment system with the latest collection of movies. The food is okayish and better than many airlines. The planes are also new. I should mention that Dubai Airport is the best airport I have visited.,3,9th December 2015,United States
1518,"We choose Emirates from CDG to PVG via DXB because of the cheap price and it had been recommended to us. However, I did not really enjoy this experience. The food is some of the best in economy class. But the IFE screen needs improvements as it is not as clear as some other airlines. The cabin crew service from Dubai to Shanghai was rude and impatient. Furthermore, the seat was not that comfortable, the space was acceptable, but the quality of the seat was poor - the headrest was made of the same material as the lazyback instead of artificial leather, so, if you put you head on it for a long time, you hair would stick to the headrest. Overall, a so-so flight. ",5,9th December 2015,China
1519,"The flight from Brisbane to Singapore was very good. Friendly and helpful staff. We had an annoying 75 minute stop in Singapore with a change of crew before the flight to Dubai. The whole demeanour of things changed. The new crew members on the whole seemed rude and abrupt. A young woman travelling on her own was not allowed a bassinet for her young child, whereas she had experienced no problems Brisbane to Singapore. I took up the advocate's role but to no avail. I asked to speak with the Purser but was brushed off. I do not intend flying Emirates again once this holiday is over.",9,8th December 2015,Australia
1520,"Recently flew Emirates from Christchurch to Stockholm, returning from Barcelona. We stopped at Sydney and Bangkok both directions. All flights were on time. The flight attendants were professional and attentive with lots of water runs between meals. Some crew were friendlier than others but you get that with every airline. The meals were great, and we got our choice on each sector. The food was tasty and varied. There have been some bad reviews regarding the 3x4x3 layout, but this wasn't a problem for us, the width of seats similar to other airlines. The aisles may be a bit narrower. Connection times were good but Dubai airport is a zoo and certainly not relaxing at all, most of the time you have to battle your way through a sea of humanity. Emirates was good value, will fly with them again.",5,4th December 2015,New Zealand
1521,"Emirates First Class from Bangkok to Hong Kong. Short hop, so no full First Class amenities available (no limo, amenity kits, First Class bar). Check in at BKK was smooth, lounge was nice, small, but with a decent selection of hot and cold food, and alcohol. Half-full cabin. Nice and chatty cabin crew, but the service seemed quite rushed. Excellent champagne, food just ok - appetisers were very cold, main course was nice, but presentation was below expectation. Suite experience, toilet with shower, and nice cabin crew made our day. Good value for money on this short sector.",10,3rd December 2015,Poland
1522,"Heathrow to Mauritius via Dubai with Emirates. Very good seat space for 2 travellers together, TV screen large with plenty of choices. Very indifferent service all four flights. Some crew really did not want to be working.

1523,"I was very pleased with the service I received on Emirates. Everyone was professional, attentive and able to handle situations with difficult passengers easily. The food was good and a lot of it. There were two meal services and a pizza service in between the meals. Drinks offered frequently. The seats were comfortable and a lot of legroom. The stars on the ceiling of the plane when it is dark outside was a nice touch. On my flight to Dubai from New York the plane was half full, so most people went to their own row and stretched out to sleep. On the way back from Dubai to New York the plane was full, but I still felt comfortable for the almost 16 hours I was on the plane. IFE was very good and I was able to finally catch up on watching movies I had not yet seen. The only small problem I had was that the free wifi was not working on my phone, but other people seemed to connect to the wifi easily. I would fly Emirates again without hesitation.",6,1st December 2015,United States

Upon boarding, FAs greeted passengers. Once seated, hot towel was distributed. After take off a refreshment was provided. I ordered a lacto-ovo diet and in my past experience, I was given sandwich and some dessert/cake, however this time I was a bit disappointed that I was only given 1 piece of vegetarian rolls. Breakfast was served about 2 hours before landing, and the best onboard breakfast that I have had. Emirates also provide stickers so flight attendants know whether to wake up or not. Inflight entertainment was superb, plenty of choices and the front/bottom aircraft camera view was available. The ICE on this aircraft hasn't been upgraded yet (wasn't ICE widescreen) but still enjoyable. Wi-fi was also available in this flight for those who prefer browsing to watching the IFE, and the connection speed was pretty fast. Apart from during take off and landing, mobile phone were allowed to be used onboard. The seat was comfortable and the headrest is adjustable. Flight attendants were friendly. Cabin and toilet was clean.  The cabin mood lighting was nice. Combs, razor and toothbrush/toothpaste availabe in the lavatory.  Overall, I had an impeccable experience with Emirates and will fly with them again.",5,30th November 2015,Australia
1525,"Mumbai to New York JFK via Dubai. Every time I fly with Emirates their service seems to be on a decline. Dubai to New York their meal service was horrible. They provided a menu which they usually do with 3 options. However the vegetarian option in the menu (both breakfast and lunch) was available only for those who had pre selected meal preferences. Not sure how it makes sense to include something in the menu when it is not really available for selection. Secondly, their flights are freezing cold and flight attendants always seem to be in a hurry to collect blankets. On one leg of the journey they collected blankets one hour prior to landing in a freezing flight. Not a pleasant flying experience overall and not worth the cost of tickets.",10,30th November 2015,United States
1526,"Cape Town to Auckland via Dubai and Brisbane in Emirates first class.  Decided to splash out. Paid just over NZD 13000 which seemed like a good deal. Flight out of Cape Town was uneventful - staff great, older aircraft but nice inside, Cape Town BIDVest lounge absolutely horrible. Arrival at Dubai is at 1am and the airport is buzzing at that time of the morning. Lounge very big and spacious. Priority fast track means nothing at Dubai. It doesn't help to show it or anything, everyone just seems to use the same lines for security. Flight to Brisbane early morning 10am departure on A380, Very new aircraft. Seat fantastic and showers just great! Staff was a bit of a miss, food pretty good though. Transit at BNE very efficient, lounge is great with lots of food options. Flight to Auckland on same aircraft, different staff and they were the best out of all the staff I had. Very attentive and caring. Flight to AKL a short hop but very nice experience. AKL immigration a pain as 3 Emirates A380s arrived in the space of 40mins.

1529,Karachi to Boston via Dubai with Emirates. I had a very disappointing experience with Emirates. I have been a travelling musician and always travel with my guitar. Having always put it close to me in the plane I always travel with a softcase. This time I travelled to Boston I was coerced at Karachi airport and given absolutely no choice but to check in my guitar. Knowing the fragility of a guitar it is unacceptable to check it in regardless of all fragile handling protocol an airline may have. A guitar is too sensitive to be checked in. Upon arriving at Boston my guitar was nowhere to be found at baggage claim and after filing a claim it reached me a few days later. And when I unzipped my case I noticed my guitar's headstock is fractured and the guitar received dents regardless of Emirates ensuring fragile handling.  ,8,28th November 2015,Pakistan
1530,Singapore to Chicago via Dubai with Emirates. The crew were impatient and demanded to take away all the blankets 45mins prior to landing. Passengers were rudely awaken from their sleep during this freezing red eye flight and had blankets taken away. The crew then proceeded to collect all headsets in a very rude manner. I assume all these is to help turn around the aircraft quicker but this results in a very horrible flying experience. Not to mention the food is also cold and of poor quality. I have had experience with many other airlines around the world and this is certainly the worst service and worst food ever. I will never take Emirates again. For similar value I would choose Qatar airways.,5,28th November 2015,Singapore
1531,Delhi to Melbourne via Dubai. Check in good and fast and the Delhi Lounge not bad. Flight out of Delhi was delayed and cancelled due to technical reasons. Delhi airport staff do not know how to handle a crisis. Passengers were left high and dry. Hotels and/or comfort was not provided to passengers in a reasonable manner. Replacement flight EK8515 left Delhi 20 hrs later. Crew on the replacement flight pretty bad. Food on board Emirates flights is very poor now. EK406 to MEL. Flight departed and arrived on time. IFE not bad. Wifi advertised was slow and bad. Bottom line is that Emirates is suffering from over expansion. The airline has lost common grip and basics of customer care. Being a Gold member with EK I am looking elsewhere now.,9,27th November 2015,Australia

Myself and my wife prefer travelling with Emirates, due to their flexibility around routes out of Manchester and previous experience of flying with Emirates from London Heathrow and Gatwick via Dubai to Mauritius. The meals in Economy class have deteriorated in my view. The portions are much smaller and needs reviewing by Emirates. I purchased $1 of wifi access, and its reliability was poor at times, and cannot be relied upon. On a positive note, we flew on the new 2 class Airbus A380 (A6-EOP) and the flight was good (with the exception of meals). They did regularly offer drinks and snacks throughout the flight - this was not observed on the other three Emirates flights. ",6,26th November 2015,United Kingdom
1533,"This is my 6th Business class trip this year with Emirates. Checking was done in Melbourne by Qantas, all went smoothly. The EK lounge in Sydney is a nice and cosy. Great food and service. Boarding the flight was a nightmare, there was no priority lane in place, it was a dogs breakfast. I have never encountered that before on any airlines. After take off, we were given mattresses straight away - how about asking priority passengers what they would like to drink after take off and what their meal requests would be? That was a first. The crew always give the mattresses after dining. Just very strange and not logical. I was seating in 7K which was located at the very front section of the business class. After a long 1h30, we were given our departure drink and cold nuts, then asked to chose our dinner. No wine request was offered with the meal, we had to ask for it. I've asked for my cheese platter to be served after I finish my main meal. I got my starter, the chicken roulade and salad - I had to send back my meal, the whole food that I just got was far too chilled. There were pieces of ice on the Salad and the chicken, I just couldn't believe what was served on my plate.  No coffee or tea were offered to my section, no refill of our drinks or bread and I never got my cheese platter. By that stage, I've had enough. 2 hours before landing, I've ordered a Lite Bites, waited only 5 minutes which I thought was pretty amazing considering during the flight I've had to press the Call Button 3-4 times to get some water (then asked for a big bottle therefore I was sure to have the water when I needed it and without disrupting the crew) well my snack was cold so I had to send it back again! The crew who were designated to look after my section really failed on that flight, they were non existent during the flight, didn't care one bit about their passengers. I'm starting to get very annoyed with Emirates, every time it's a win or a miss but over my 6 business trips this year it has been a miss.

The flight is around 21 hrs not including transfers & upon recommendations from several friends we decided to travel with Emirates. I do not have one good thing to say about them! We experienced every family's worst fears about international plane travel with everything from poor, slow service, judgemental staff, pathetic kids meals (the kids were served spaghetti bolognaise on 5/6 flights), rude staff refusing to give the kids their 'complimentary' toy (which we had to beg for!), and to top it all off we had all been separated on one flight, despite booking our seats online. My four year old son and seven year old daughter were sitting 10 and 15 rows away from myself with my husband sitting another 7 rows behind me! All up we were spread right through the economy cabin and no-one wanted to help us, each blaming the next point of transfer as the responsible party. Originally I made an online complaint to Emirates while on holiday, hoping at the bare minimum, they'd be able to offer some palatable food to our children inflight. The response I got, as well as being ridiculously late and outside the timeframe given, was pathetic; suggesting I should just bring my own food in future, with no useful advice or empathy shown! Emirates has been my worst flight experience ever, I am a rather experienced traveller, having flown with at least 15 different airlines and never have I been so dismally disappointed. I will never fly with Emirates again.",4,24th November 2015,Australia
1535,"My husband and I purchased tickets for $38,000. to fly first class on Emirates from San Francisco to Johannesburg via Dubai. It was going to be our ""trip of a lifetime"" so we spent the extra money to try the first class experience we had heard so much about. We boarded the plane and were served drinks, but about an hour later we had to de-plane due to an electrical failure. We waited in the airport and were given hourly updates for the next 5-7 hours while we waited to board again and take off. Eventually the flight was cancelled. We got no information at the airport from Emirates about what to do, where to go, or how to rebook. After several more hours getting our bags and finding our way out of the airport we bumped into a fellow passenger who told us Emirates would pay for a room at a local hotel. We went to the hotel and were not able to get information about rebooking our flight until 2:00 am. The flight went out the following day but involved 2 hours of waiting in line to get checked in. My husband is blind and I had one leg in a cast so the delay was really excruciating. We were awarded 100,000 Skyward miles for the inconvenience. The delay caused us to lose out on the first day of our Safari which cost us roughly $2000, and we could not recoup. I wrote a letter to Emirates saying that we understood these mechanical problems do happen but given the cost of our ticket we wanted better compensation.  I got a polite letter back telling us basically ""no"" that they had done all they were going to do, and that was the end of it. I was pretty stunned at that response given that after having paid $38,000. ",3,23rd November 2015,United States

We were 2 hours into the flight before we were offered a drink and even then the stewardess seemed uninterested. The food was bland and repetitive. There were two options with one always being chicken. There was never enough of the second meal choice option. The seating was comfortable with good legroom. Entertainment was okay but the same on each connecting flight. Some screens also failed on the plane causing complaints. On a whole, an average experience for the price.

Our bassinet seats were changed on all flights apart from Heathrow to Dubai despite having reserved and requested bassinet seats. The staff attitude was terrible as our seats were changed at Dubai and they just would not give me a reason despite asking on a number of occasions to why they have changed our seats, upon checking my reserved seats once boarded only to discover another couple with a child sitting in our reserved seats. On return flight from Dubai to London we were told a number of times we had got my bassinet seats as reserved even up until the point we was boarding. When we boarded the plane we had recieved seats 1 behind the Bassinet seats -  so I complained and nothing was done about it. However,  a nice passenger in one of the bassinet seats gave his up so my wife could sit there with the baby, he and many others around could not understand why we had been changed and people not needing bassinet seats given them. I have flown with Emirates for many years, but this was by far the worst trip ever in terms of staff attitude and making this journey more difficult than needed be especially whilst traveling with a 2 month old baby.

1540,Manchester to Doha via Dubai return with Emirates. We arrived at the airport to find that the plane had been changed and our seats that we had carefully selected had been changed - with us scattered all over the place. This is not just an inconvenience but made worse when you are travelling with children - other cheaper airlines have noticed that we are travelling with children and have made sure we are seated together even when we have not paid extra for this (like Thomas Cook). The ground staff managed to find us seats together in the end but much further back in the plane. To make it worse they did the same thing on the way home on our Doha to Dubai flight. This time I checked just before we left and rang them - they could only seat 4 of us together and the rest were scattered. When I got home I emailed them to complain and after a long time got a reply to say that this is just how it is. I expected better for a company that sells itself as having good service and are so expensive. Its a sad day when I get better service from a holiday company chartered flight compared to Emirates. After all the messing about spoiled the flight - this is one of the best parts of the holiday for my family.

I was surprised with the flight attendant that has different languages, 18 in total, this would be very helpful with the passenger who couldn’t speak English very fluently. The meal for me was standard, as I could find a meal better in other airlines. I hope I could get better meal in my next flight to Paris since I thought the flight would use A380, but it was still the same. The flight attendant seemed so hurried in serving the meals. The meal to Paris was served a bit later until dinner time, and I was like starving since they didn’t give us more snack. The best thing in the flight was the IFE.

During meal time, I saw an old couple not get the meal. When everyone had half of his meal, they still don’t get the meal. IFE was good during the whole flight. The flight Dubai to Jakarta (Boeing 777) was not as good as I had thought. For almost 1/3 of the journey I could not sleep on my seat.

Second lot of security before getting on the plane that wouldn't allow me to take my water bottle that I had brought at the departure gate. Not in the seat I had allocated online for. Admittedly the rest of my negative experience I can't blame Emirates for. But I do think they should get rid of the ability to put the seat so far back. I basically had the guy in front on my lap the whole way, and I was trying to sleep by leaning on the fold up tray, when he forced his seat right back - it resulted in a limb on my head and a cricked neck.

1547,"New York JFK to Milan. I've flown the Emirates A380 on short haul flights from BKK to HKG in First Class which is a noticeable improvement over the Business Class product. As many write, there are a number of seats in the Business Class cabin that are much worse than others. I did my homework before selecting the outbound seats. Per recommendation (traveling with a significant other), I picked seats 20 E/F that had the mini bar on the aisle, which allows you to sit closer to your friend/partner/spouse. The problem with these is that our middle armrests were so small and narrow that really only one of us could use it at a time. On our flight back to New York we opted to sit apart and chose seats 18K and 20K. These seats have the mini bar on the aisle, and you do have a nice more private experience. The huge plus of these seats is that you get lots of storage space next to your seat under the windows that is nonexistent in the other middle seat configurations (E/F and D/G). This allows you to put away your laptop bag, blanket etc, without getting up into the overhead bins during flight. This would also be the case for the ""A"" seats on the other side of the plane. We found these much more comfortable and didn't mind sitting apart for the flight. The flight attendants are very hit or miss with Emirates. On our outbound JFK-Milan flight, most were pretty bad. Not particularly helpful or available. They disappear after the very rushed dinner service. On our return flight the good FAs outnumbered the bad. The thing that agitated the most on both flights is the disregard that the attendants have for being quiet. They love to congregate and talk loudly between sections behind row 21. As well, they seemed to always getting into the overhead bins and slamming them shut. This woke me us several times. The other thing that I disliked is that the restrooms are next to the galley in the back of the Business class cabin in such a way that it almost seemed unsanitary and without privacy. You have the toilets between the lounge/bar with uncovered food, and the galley where they are preparing food. With no curtain separating the toilet section from the galley section, you have a bunch of FAs standing around on one side and guests in the bar area on the other that you must walk through to get to and from the toilet. We found the food offering pretty subpar for a business class product. The beverage service and offering was above average.",2,9th November 2015,United Kingdom

I was unhappy with the Check-In staff member who mistakenly added the weight of my carry-on cabin bag to my Checked luggage, requiring me to repack my bags, but when I eventually got back to (different) check-in desk my checked luggage was well under the 30kgs allowed, so I ended up checking both bags and carrying the plastic bag that I was going to post as my carry-on. The difference between the two service staff was marked - this is the second time this has happened. The meals on Emirates in Economy have deteriorated in the last year or so, probably because Emirates operates a codeshare arrangement with Qantas on this route, so they are maybe catering to Qantas customers. The cabin staff are very professional and helpful, The beer on board is supermarket class offering a Dutch and USA option with a Dutch light alternative rather than options from Oceania or Asia which I would prefer, still the staff offer options rather than just what is close to hand. The wine is quite reasonable given it is cool and drunk at altitude. The in-flight entertainment is superior unless the person in front insists on fully reclining their seat even during meals which makes viewing the screen extremely unpleasant, but this is probably more a reflection on the type of passenger Emirates attracts with their code share arrangement with Qantas than on the actual seat.",6,7th November 2015,Australia
1549,"Emirates A380 provides you with excellent flat-bed seat with great privacy, best IFE around, and good drinks. The onboard bar/lounge is a nice to have, and fun place to go for a walk. Quality of the FAs is unpredictable, had some outstanding ones while others were really sub-par. Catering on EK business class is below quality offered by QR economy class, but I do not fly for the food experience. Just give me a superior seat/bed, the better IFE, and a global routes network.",2,7th November 2015,Belgium

No complaints  and based on our experience on these flights would definitely use Emirates again.",1,7th November 2015,United Kingdom
1551,Durban to Gatwick via Dubai. The Emirates inflight entertainment helps you to not notice the space your seat in economy has to offer on the Boeing 777-300ER. The A380 from Dubai to London Heathrow no issues. Will fly Emirates on this route and will not hold it against them if they squeeze the extra seats and keep it economical to fly.,3,5th November 2015,United Kingdom
1552,"Check in at Glasgow was a bit unpleasant, with the counter staff insisting on weighing and tagging hand luggage, which already had an Emirates Skywards Gold Card on it. Every airline has frosty staff. The lounge in Glasgow is pleasant and well presented. The aircraft on the Glasgow to Dubai Leg was modern and in good condition. Inflight entertainment was good with WIFI available. Quality of cabin service was good with a good selection of food and drinks. Flight landed on time with good communication from the cockpit. Transfers in Dubai Airport are pretty simple and painless. Boarding in Dubai for the flight to Addis Ababa was a shambles. For some reason all the staff were rude and looked a bit confused. The aircraft to ADD was awful, a very old Airbus that should have been retired a long time ago. Emirates lost my luggage. They have no local agent in ADD (not sure if thats true but it is what I was told). I then had to find my own luggage, namely travelling out to the airport to try and find my own luggage on subsequent days. The Emirates product you would normally expect in other countries is almost non existent in Addis Ababa. Rude staff, poor Lost baggage processes, very old aircraft.",5,4th November 2015,United Kingdom
1553,"Flew London Gatwick to Melbourne return with Emirates, two segments were on the older Boeing 777 Dubai to Melboune, business class seats 9J aisle, ok - but the service was excellent as was food. Cabin crew introduced themselves at the start of the flight and made sure that you had everything you wanted. The seat on this leg was just an angled lie flat seat, with a foot rest to stop you slipping off the end, and it needed the mattress to make it more comfortable. It was different on the LGW Dubai LGW segments as this was on the A380, seat 9k was extemely comfortable, although the gap to get in was very narrow if you are slighly larger person. Again the service and food was excellent, could not fault it. If I fly to Melbourne again with Emirates will try and make sure its the A380 all the way, just for the comfort.",1,3rd November 2015,United Kingdom
1554,"A380 excellent aircraft. Awful Emirates service. I had high expectations of flying on this aircraft back to London from Dubai. The flight was 3 hours delayed with the only explanation being that there was technical difficulties. Unless you travel by business class or first class you are treated like cattle and hearded on to the plane as such. Once onboard it doesn't get any better in cattle class. Requests for anything, like an extra blanket because it was so cold, are dismissed and you are left wondering if they misunderstood you or just chose to dismiss your request. I chose to fly Emirates only because of the A380 but if I knew the staff were going to be so rude I wouldn't have bothered. Next time I'll read the airline reviews before deciding how to travel. One good point about the aircraft is the Internet access, I can write this review while I'm on the flight.",10,3rd November 2015,United Kingdom

Close to 300 passengers with similar issues greeted by 2 people on the counter. After complaining the staff called security who threatened the passengers for taking away their passport as if they have any legal right to do so. They also told passengers not to make any noise. In addition the last time I have checked in to Emirates at JFK I have been asked to place my hand carry so they can weigh it, no word of getting late, how are you, welcome, nothing. End result : 5 hours later; 6 more hours lay over, $15 meal voucher. This is unacceptable.",3,3rd November 2015,United States

Entertainment center easy to navigate with a good variety of choices. Seats comfortable. Check seating plan and look at row 66 and 67. Lots of space and near restrooms. In all, we will fly Emirates next time to Europe. Easy connections to Aegean Airlines if going to Greece. This airline will be among the players very soon.",9,2nd November 2015,United States

FAs were friendly however they ignored my call bells.,8,31st October 2015,United Arab Emirates

Even the toilet facilities were roomy and well appointed. Staff were courteous and pleasant however myself and my travelling companion (both women in our mid fifties) often were overlooked with some service details while the young male passenger seated on the aisle next to us was always attended to, had meal trays collected (ours were left) and received regular complimentary drinks but we were never asked. A friend (also an older woman) mentioned she had a similar experience travelling business class with Emirates in May 2015 and had to ask the male passenger seated on the aisle next to her to assist with service requests. I've not experienced this with other airlines and maybe this needs to be addressed at the training level.",7,30th October 2015,Australia
1560,"We were planning a trip to Perth to see our daughter, tragically my wife fell ill, diagnosed terminal within a few days. Just a few weeks later on the day the flight was leaving, after an Emirates flight reminder, she died in just 7 short weeks. During her illness I tried to cancel the flight and use the money to fly my daughter back. Although I thought I had purchased one return ticket with one set of conditions that allowed cancellation, the return flight unknown to me had its own set of conditions that precluded any refund. After many emails and phone calls I was not able to cancel the flight and get a refund. After family help, with no help from Emirates, we got enough money together get my daughter home, tragically too late. During that time Emirates thanked me for my understanding and refused to help quoting terms and conditions of the return ticket and refused to consider changing a ticket to allow my daughter to fly back. They would retain my money and provide no help. During my wife’s illness MacMillan Cancer Support contacted Emirates on several occasions and attempted to help get my daughter home using the tickets or a refund on the purchased tickets. The same reply was given to MacMillan Cancer Support as was given to me, despite them talking to senior staff. Emirates final email thanked me for my understanding in these difficult times, saying they could do nothing to help. MacMillan Cancer Support wrote to Emirates to express their concerns over the lack of compassion and support, to-date there has been no reply. If you fly with Emirates pray you will not need their help because they will thank you for your understanding and take your money and leave you alone to sort it out.",9,29th October 2015,United Kingdom

1562,"Budapest - Dubai - Budapest. Cabin crew were charming, maybe more water should be provided without asking, food was delicious. Announcements were maybe a bit too frequent, entertainment was just ok, seating was very not comfy but the latter ones are due to the old type of aircraft. Overall, tickets are a bit overpriced, but still worth flying Emirates.",7,27th October 2015,Hungary
1563,"Flew Emirates in Business class from Budapest to Shanghai via Dubai. Check in was fast and able to use fast track security. Emirates use the Skycourt lounge in Budapest which is nothing to write home about. Cold food offering, cheap wine and some spirits. Seating was comfortable, but no natural light in the lounge at all. A330 is the Achilles heel of Emirates. I am not sure how they can get away with sending such an uncompetitive aircraft to Budapest. The seats are narrow, recline is limited and are terrible for anything more than a few hours. Food and service was excellent and the staff were very friendly and chatty. Overall, not a bed flight apart from the seats. Used the Emirates lounge in concourse B which is excellent. The food and drinks offerings are outstanding and there are a number of great seating options. The lounge is truly enormous and it would be easy to spend a long time in here. I was actually disappointed when I had to leave. The only complaint was the shower room was extremely hot which made getting dressed very uncomfortable. Second flight on an A380 was excellent. The seat is very comfortable and offers great privacy. Being a night flight, service was limited so as to let people sleep. I put the seat in lie flat mode and slept for the best part of 6 hours. Breakfast was served before arrival in Shanghai and it was once again, very good. On arrival in Shanghai, first and business class have a separate baggage carousel and bags arrived promptly. Emirates provide a great service and connecting in Dubai is flawless. The lounge is really heaven on earth.",6,27th October 2015,Ireland
1564,"Newcastle to Dubai return.The food on board was virtually inedible, and we were offered one drink on a 7.5 hour flight. The staff were unhelpful and if a question was asked or a request made, the look you received was painful.  The flight to Dubai was exactly the same. This this was my first time in this region. I felt the people in the UAE were so friendly and helpful and Dubai is spotlessly clean, our only real disappointment was Emirates. The captain announced that there were eleven cabin staff on the plane - what were they doing? One girl was kind and had a smile. She even admitted to us that she didn't and wouldn't eat the meals on board.  I had an elderly parent in Business Class and he fared little better apparently. We had approximately forty minutes waiting on luggage, whilst there was no other plane landed at Newcastle competing for resources. This may be an issue with the airport, but worth mentioning as indicative of the poor service we received. ",5,26th October 2015,United Kingdom

I was disappointed to see that if you choose to pay in cash for the ticket through a bank in Thailand there is a new local EK service fee of 600 baht as opposed to a standard EK Western Union transfer fee of 200 baht. The online checkin was smooth and the check in staff at BKK and LHR helpful. Flights were on time and the aircraft was clean and well maintained on all sectors. The ICE system kept me entertained for hours and I noticed they have changed to new square softer headphones. The transit in Dubai was smooth and professionally controlled. I did not eat anything so I cant comment on the food. The crew were charming, I have noticed a massive shift in crew attitude over the past 2 years. Emirates is now my airline of choice once again.",9,24th October 2015,Thailand
1566,Birmingham to Brisbane via Dubai. I flew Emirates 5 years ago and was very impressed. What a difference this time. The staff were unsmiling and unfriendly to passengers. Meals were slow and on both legs one of the meal options was not available by the time they got to us. On the second occasion I refused the meal offered as I didn't want another stew and I had had enough. I was eventually provided with the meal I wanted but it was put down with ill grace. My partner is vegetarian but he is not vegan. Surely Emirates could provide for both and not treat vegetarians as vegan? His meals were awful and inadequate and he had to have my cheese and biscuits as he was left hungry.,9,23rd October 2015,United Kingdom

First leg Lisbon to Dubai on old Boeing 777-300, old ICE and small screen, nice journey because crew were fantastic, very late timing leaving Lisbon, fantastic team in Dubai waiting with signs to take us to the next flight. EK 408 also a Boeing 777-300 to Melbourne with technical stop in Kuala Lumpur. This was a new plane or at least with fantastic seats on the back, great flight. In Melboune waited for EK 406 to take us to Auckland, full flight, don't like so much the A380-800, the seats a bit more space but less privacy like the Boeing 777-300. A very good experience with Emirates.",8,23rd October 2015,Portugal
1568,"The lure of a stopover in Dubai when flying Orlando to Cape Town was strong. Departed Orlando on the third day after the inaugural flight. In Business Class, Emirates offers limo pick up, which we did. I need a wheelchair, and that went very smoothly to the Business Lounge in Orlando - they were using a very small space, but nice lunch buffet. Seats 9A/B were fairly comfortable as were the other seats we had. Thank goodness for the addition of the long pad for sleeping. Remember the days of Delta being called ""Chicken airline"" because of their chicken meals, then Emirates should be called ""The Reboot airline"". On each of our four segments the computer had to be rebooted because either the ICE did not work, or the partition would not retract or the seat would not go into a flat position. Eventually my daughter had to move to another seat so she could sleep lying down - after all that is what we paid for. Otherwise, I would recommend Emirates to everyone. The service was excellent with only 40 business class passengers on the outward flight to Dubai, and 30 on the return flight. The flight attendants on the Orlando/Dubai segments both ways were so personable and looked after all the passengers. On the Dubai/Capetown segments they were competent, but aloof. One glitch was the wheelchair in Dubai on return trip - was told it was unnecessary as we would be in transit lounge. Not true. And in Orlando the chair was not visible until I finally just sat in the baggage lounge and said I was not going anywhere. We were fortunate to pay $8,000 for the two of us as a special offer.",5,21st October 2015,United States

One of my traveling companions had a bad allergic reaction to a product bought at the airport, and the crew went out of their way so much.  After our stopover in Singapore, the new cabin crew had been informed that my companion was not well. They kept an attentive eye throughout the entire flight and when we asked for some chocolate and they forgot because they were so busy, they went to Business Class and got the chocolate from there. At Dubai we noticed they cost about $50USD for a box of 6! I will fly Emirates in the future, best airline I have been on.",9,20th October 2015,Australia

Found seats had little lumber support and narrow which after spending 17 hours in them, both my husband and I were  in pain. Food was poor, ordered vegetarian and got given 'vegan' on the way out so had to call Emirates to change this for this leg. Husband had chicken, which was ok but why serve gravy on a full flight with no elbow room? Equally spaghetti with tomato sauce? Constant passenger announcements disturbed inflight entertainment which was very irritating, and very loud in the earphones. Overall disappointed with comfort, promptness of schedule and noise levels on plane.",9,18th October 2015,United Kingdom

Could not use the inflight entertainment system due to bassinet seat installed in front of me for my son. Why do they provide menu cards when they don't have all the food available all the time. My seat was 56J/K. and air hostess always skip these seats which is next to kitchen, and they would start from the seat right behind ours. They provided food and did not bother to pick up trays for at least 45 minutes - many people end up going themselves to kitchen and put the trays back. During the flight they never offered tea or coffee to us.",1,17th October 2015,United States

They are often late these days and I now leave at least a 4 hour gap to make sure I make the next flight in Dubai. For the latest flight from Manila to Dubai they forgot that there is heavy traffic on a Friday night and the crew arrived over 2 hours late - if all the passengers can get to the Airport on time then why can't the crew? What is so bad is that the ground staff lied about the situation when they told the economy passengers the aircraft needed more cleaning, but told the business class passengers the truth. There is no doubt that Emirates is undergoing a decline in service.",7,16th October 2015,Philippines
1575,"I was able to choose my seats for all four sectors on the round trip. I'm not a big man, so economy seating rarely presents me with a problem, and for me the available legroom was fine regardless of aircraft type. The A380 was a cut above the others in terms of comfort and quietness though, but the service was a little wooden and certainly slow, but the food was not bad at all. Service was slightly better on the DXB-SGN return legs, food reasonable but nothing to write home about. One thing I wish Emirates would move away from is the overcrowded serving tray or at least change the shape of it! A square tray balanced on a rectangular seat table is not a great fit. Entertainment was good, except for the Boeing 777 leg (limited choices and poor picture quality), so slept, read, listened to music on that one. Certainly not the greatest service onboard but adequate; nothing that would stop me flying with them again, certainly for the value for money I get, and the convenience (from my perspective at least) of the flight times. Dubai T3 is another story altogether though; I've flown this route a few times now and it remains the worst part of the journey for me. It's not the two to three hour stop-over, I quite welcome the chance to get out, stretch, wash and change clothes, but the building itself - I find it poorly signposted, and just so busy and bustling I struggle to relax there. Would certainly use them again.",8,15th October 2015,United Kingdom

The outbound flight from Dubai to Singapore was a nightmare, the plane was completely full and seating very bad, very little room. Tried to forget about the inconvenience by watching (ridiculously censored) films, but arrived exhausted from sitting in a cramped position for many hours.

Cabin Crew were friendly, helpful and professional, with soft drinks and water offered frequently throughout all the flights. Meals were hot, with a choice of 2 main courses for dinner, and breakfast, and snacks were offered in between times too - actually this was unnecessary, as I had too much to eat. The seats could be more spacious and comfortable, but in Economy, this is never going to happen - you get what you pay for.

As I has enjoyed a great breakfast in the Emirates lounge prior to my departure I only had the lite continental breakfast which was pleasant. I have a disability and as my seat was closer to the pointy end of the A380 when I went to use the bathroom I was quietly told I may use the First class facility as First class was empty. Just before landing in Auckland the attendant who had looked after me came and said goodbye then placed a Godiva chocolate with a small hand written note to enjoy my onward travels. Such a personal and special gesture. On arrival a wheelchair awaited me at the aircraft door and 40 min later I was thru customs and on my way to my domestic connection.

However there was turbulence which the pilot deemed bad enough to warrant asking the cabin crew to return to their seats a total of five times during lunch service!

Following takeoff, watched a movie, got the seat into bed position with mattress and duvet, closed the doors and slept. Woke after 6 hours, ordered food and about two hours from Dubai used one of the two showers. Onward flight to Manchester, again A380, was the same and using the shower meant we arrived fresh.

We were told to go to the National Express (bus) counter and get a bus to Heathrow. The bus arrived about 40 minutes later and we arrived at Heathrow at 1pm at the central bus station. It seemed to be about 1 mile walk to the Emirates check in. No trolleys were allowed on the walk : there were several trolley barriers during the walk.  When we arrived at the Emirates check in we were not in their system. Emirates at Gatwick had forgotten to re ticket us. We had to go to the Emirates counter to get ticketed and then back to check in. We were then the last people to be seated and we could not sit together. When I boarded I was seated next to an enormous man who sat with his legs apart and his arms spread out invading my seat space. My economy Emirates ticket was AUD $2800 which is very expensive. I'd traveled to France in May 2015 and my ticket was AUD $1700. We only got seating to Dubai and our boarding pass from Dubai to Brisbane was marked as standby even though we were picking up our original flight from Dubai to Brisbane. We had to get seating in Dubai and again we were not able to sit together. Again I was seated next to a very large man. I will never travel with Emirates again.

Most of the passengers were transferring, being after another flight, tired, hungry and thirsty. Many children were on the flight too. Everybody just wanted to have some meal, something to drink as soon as possible and then sleep. But we had to wait for a long time for it to happen. Even when eventually the crew started serving it was very slow and unprofessional. They accidentally splashed drinks over passengers, pushed them without even apologising.  I will not recommend Emirates. ",1,11th October 2015,Australia
1587,Usually fly Emirates to Singapore as enjoy that it is an evening flight and you arrive in Singapore just before midnight. Check in was easy and headed straight to the Emirates Lounge. One thing I have noticed with the lounge over the years is that it has not been upgraded and service has been degrading for some time know. Food is average at best and the decor was very ordinary when comparing it to the other lounges. Decided not to upgrade onboard as flight was empty and had a whole row to my self. Flight was comfortable and meals adequate but not the best by far and the crew this time were excellent and flight was on time.

We have strict Vegetarian diet and the special meal requests were properly delivered on all segments. Kids goodies were pretty high spec.

Toilets onboard the aircraft were not cleaned and as the flight progressed more of them became 'out of order'. In over 20 hours of flying, tea and coffee was served twice.

We flew 4 sectors within 3 weeks with them, and  the check-in on all airports used was smooth and didn't take us long even though we were economy passengers. Aircraft were average, typical Boeing 777 but I could manage to get double seat rows on all sectors, so seating was ok. I was surprised that they really put 10 seats across in a row instead of 9 which many airlines do. Cabin crews were in general nice but realizing that there were so many of them compared to other airlines, the performance was just average. The inflight service on all 4 sectors was a joke, once it took exactly 1hr 47mins before the first bar trolley was pushed out of the galley. On all 4 sectors only one meal was served, not even a sandwich before landing which is quite poor in my opinion. Emirates competitor on flights to Dubai does a lot more with less crew. Duty free was just offered via announcement on one sector only and after the service we never saw a bar trolley again. So why does Emirate put so much crew in the cabin if they don't have to work during the flight.  I have to say that the tickets were quite cheap but others who paid more probably had the same experience.",9,5th October 2015,Austria
1594,"I found Emirates to be better after an absence of more than 10 years. Professional and courteous staff in BKK, HKG and onboard. Well appointed A380 cabin, good food and service, generous baggage allowance. Last minute changes to my return leg were efficiently handled. ",1,5th October 2015,Thailand
1595,"I did 4 flights with Emirates over a 3 week period and on each trip there was issues. Seats and entertainment was fine with no issues. Service and food horrendous. Cabin crew were rude and only thing they where interested in was how quickly they could dish the meals out. Have put a complaint in with Emirates due to a member of staff 'pushing' my fiancé out the way when letting another passanger sit down. On the way home even though sitting next to the cabin crew station, they wouldn't answer the cabin crew service button so I could buy duty free. Also having to listen to the lead cabin crew staff member tell off her staff was a joke. Avoid if you can.",8,4th October 2015,United Kingdom
1596,"Ground staff at Lisbon we're polite and good natured, but they couldn't for some reason check me for the 2nd leg of my flight from Dubai to Sydney despite trying for sometime, and in the end I told them I'd sort it in Dubai - in hindsight a mistake. The flight was pleasant enough, although as this is Emirates you'll have to endure Arabic subtitles over your movies. I'm not sure why as an international airline they don't offer non subtitled option. Arrived at Dubai and no information about my next flight anywhere. Lined up at Emirates customer service only to be told by a very rude and disinterested customer rep to go to customer service next door and then waved away. Everyone has a bad day so let it go thanked her and went next door. Next customer service rep was the same, told me to catch the train and waved me away. Walked away feeling a little a bit annoyed at Emirates for not being just a little more polite.  I then had to cross security twice in queues to finally get to a Qantas desk. Got there to be greeted by a fairly happy and polite rep who handed me my boarding pass with an upgrade to business.  Excellent, or so I thought - I spent the next 6 hours waiting for the flight, even made arrangements to take my kids first thing in the morning when I land due to being fresh at the other end. Got to the boarding gate in the lounge, made to wait 15 minutes as the rep was late, to be bumped back down to premium economy by a rude Emirates Rep! Didn't properly click what was going on until I got to the door of the aircraft where I approached the Qantas cabin crew. The first girl was disinterested, non-empathetic and in the end I had to walk away from her. In the end I got to talk to a cabin supervisor and after being questioned by one of his peers (insinuating that maybe I'd made up the story) might not have been the intention but perception is reality especially after only a couple of hours sleep. I was told that 3 people were mistakenly upgraded and that the Lisbon Emirates ground staff shouldn't have upgraded me. I briefly explained that they had nothing to do with it. So I was stuck where I was - I guess you get what you pay for. I was a platinum FF for 5-6 years now I'm just a gold it's amazing how differently you get treated. ",10,2nd October 2015,Australia
1597,"This is the second time I flown Emirates Business class to Europe from my home town of Adelaide. The check in was courteous when I asked for my luggage to be tagged as fragile. Boarding was swift. My only complaint at this point in time is the lack of lounge in Adelaide, and we had the share the domestic Qantas lounge which was accessible prior to immigration and custom check. That means that I have very little lounge time. Once boarded the plane, welcome drink was served. Personal introduction by the chief purser of the cabin. Whilst evening meal was offered, we were also offered the option of having breakfast or not being woken up. I chose to have breakfast as it was a long flight of 12 hrs to Dubai. The aircraft departed on time. Hot nuts and a second drink was served prior before the main meal. The options and portions were generous. The food choices were tasty. The seats were comfortable, and better with a soft comforter. The IFE choices were great with latest movies available. There was a separate tablet console which made navigation through their IFE system easier. Time passed very quickly and after breakfast, we soon landed. A good meal and good rest made this overnight travel easier. ",5,2nd October 2015,Australia
1598,"My wife and I heard a lot about Emirates: new planes, incredible service and even chauffer ride. We decided to try it on our vacation, as there was a nonstop flight JFK to Milan. The van was on time and the fact that the driver farted did not break our high spirits. It was not too hot and an opened widow saved us. At JFK they did not have a separate line for Business class or Global Access and it took us more time than anticipated to get through. The lounge was calm, clean, fresh air, great selection of food and premium drinks. On board we were greeted with Veuve Clicquot and a selection of juices. My wife asked for different juice and it was produced in seconds. The plane looked new with a lot of gadgets. Stewards were very nice and friendly and were only interested in servicing us even better. We were offered a great selection of premium drinks and very good wines. The dinner meals selection was also good, served hot and delicious like at very good Manhattan restaurant. After dinner the beds were made with mattresses and we had a good rest. In the morning, we had a great breakfast. On exit the chauffer was already waiting and the ride to Milan was very nice. All our expectation were exceeded. On the way back there was a separate line for business class and it took us minuets to get to the lounge, where, again, there was a great selection of tasty food and premium drinks waiting for us. A nice touch: the gate was inside the lounge and it took us few steps to get to our seats. I told my wife that I would rather fly Emirates with a layover in Dubai than a direct to Europe with another airline. On the plane we were greeted with a great selection of orange juice only and when I asked for cranberry, had a beaming smile as an answer and stewardess left. Next time we saw her taking drink orders. I asked what Scotch they had, but she did not know what I meant. I asked for whiskey and she offered John Daniels without alternatives. I decided to try something new and was rewarded with Johnny Walker (I think by taste). Contrary to our first experience, to see a stewardess we had to call and wait for awhile and she always came giving the impression that we drew her away from something important. For dinner we had a selection of two wines: red and white and she did not know what a Wine card was. But she promised that her colleague will come to help me which never happened. I can't say speak to food quality, because she brought somebody else's order and I did not have a chance to get mine. No beds. For breakfast I ordered hot beef sandwich which was served deadly cold. When I asked to warm it - beaming smile and it disappeared, forever. We had the imprudence to check my suit in, shortly before the final descent my wife and I asked for it, five times, but tough luck, I got it when all people were clearing the plane and had to change in the airport bathroom. We were out a bit early and did not find our chauffer at the exit area. We waited for about 30 minutes, until I found the Emirates desk where we were told that my ride is waiting for me outside terminal and around the corner. On the way back we left the highway and stopped as chauffer needed to use the bathroom, which, to be honest, was better than farting. We can take any airline anywhere, but we don’t pay a premium for the flight, we pay it for a service. At home my wife asked: ""Emirates again?"" and we laughed.",10,1st October 2015,United States
1599,"Very stressful and unhelpful Emirates ground/check-in service overall on my New York to Dubai trip. Chaotic with the limousine service in New York. Really bad reception in Dubai trying to get a hotel voucher and visa through Emirates ground service. Lady at desk gave me a bunch of papers and asked me to go to the bank around the corner, where the papers were stamped. Then I went back to the first point only to be told that there was no need to return I could go through passport control! Maybe tell that, so people do not have to go back/forth. At JFK check in, I asked about an upgrade to first class. ""Sorry, I do not know how to do that!"" was the reply. Maybe ask someone how? After printing boarding cards I asked her again if she could find out about upgrading (Emirates had an upgrade offer for points on the day). She left and came back saying it could not be done - I suspect because she had already given me the boarding cards. Of course it turned out that there were empty first class seats available on the flight. Flights uneventful - but very disappointing overall.",8,1st October 2015,Denmark
1600,"I love the Emirates A380.  I have been flying Emirates since 2010, 2 flights per year and I have to say that this is probably one of the most stressful ones as of yet. I was transiting via Dubai with Emirates and we left Doha quite late and had to literally run to our gate. We had to be escorted by ground staff just for us to make our next flight. I got to the gate and I was probably one of the last few to get on, which was a relief. I go on really short 5-day holidays and my schedule is pretty lean. Not making it to a flight will probably ruin my itinerary a whole lot. Anyway, when I got to the plane, it was quite hectic. DXB-HKG is always mad, I've been flying this route regularly for the past couple of years and it's pretty busy. The staff was not as courteous as before. Seats are standard, but mine would not recline. Not sure if the seat was faulty or the passenger behind me just had really long legs. I have to comment on how the cabin crew looked really exhausted and worn out and we had not even left yet! Uniforms all wrinkled and presence was just sending out vibes of tiredness.",1,30th September 2015,Qatar
1601,"Emirates has a super F-class product. The driver takes you from home to the airport. Check in easy and efficient and you can go to the Emirates lounge in Manchester and a superb one in Dubai. The lounge in Cape town has a fantastic shower but lounge is overcrowded sadly. A380 between Manchester and Dubai is fantastic, an excellent suite with privacy doors. The food is served whenever you want it, whether you want a full meal, snack or a combination. The food is very good, the Meze and caviar were highlights for me. The bar at the back of business is fun. They even bring 2004 Dom to drink. The wine is some of the best in the world, including a sumptious St Emillion. Fun on the A380 is the shower, a proper glass-doored cabinet. You are allowed 5 mins of water, you can switch it off between bursts. The shower room has a heated floor which is magnificent.  Afterwards they offer fresh tea and fruit, all very civilised!  The crew on all the flights were brilliant, though the crew on the way home from Dubai to Manchester just edged it! They were so friendly and helpful. The Boeing 777 from Dubai to Cape Town is a less glamorous aircraft but the service and comfort was top notch. I think this is the most relaxing way to travel.",9,30th September 2015,United Kingdom
1602,"We expected a lot from Emirates, but were unfortunately a little disappointed on our flight from Bangkok to Venice via Dubai. The crew on the plane was quite unorganised. The meals were mixed up. We ordered two children’s menus and two special meals and we were lucky enough our meals were not mixed, but our neighbors did not get the special meals they ordered. The staff apologised, however this is not what you would expect from Emirates. Other children on the flight got the toys, but they forgot our children (both 5 years old) and they were very disappointed. Afterwards we had to ask stewardess to please give them something - so later they received the entertainment set. We were quite disappointed with crew services. The entertainment system was excellent, the variety of movies, music you could choose. Wi-Fi was payable.",4,29th September 2015,Slovenia
1603,"Customer service is really lacking on Emirates. The food in the main cabin was awful, dry and tasteless. The stewards are not very courteous either leaving another bad taste in your mouth. On the flight to Bangkok, I tried to purchase two duty free items but was denied when I produced my driver's license and credit card. According to the steward he could not sell the item to me unless I signed my card. I told him that for safety reasons I do not sign the card and this is a very antiquated rule since the cards now carry a chip. The 3 stewards made quite a scene because I refused to sign my card. After a while I simply asked them to leave me alone and reminded them that this is not a necessity. They all left mumbling to each other. On my return flight from BKK I showed up at the airport with 2 pieces of checked baggage. The staff at the counter told me I was only entitled to one bag and I would have to pay for the other. Of course I said no problem expecting a reasonable price. To my surprise the representative quoted me over 22,000 BHT for the bag. I told her I was only checking an extra bag and not an extra person. She explained that according to my ticket, I have to pay by the kilo per bag. Still in shock, I asked to talk to the manager who was not in any way helpful.",7,28th September 2015,United Kingdom

1606,"When I first travelled Emirates over 5 years ago I could not sing their praises enough. However I have just returned from Munich having one of the worst experiences ever. After moving seats because my entertainment screen did not work, I was seated in one of the two remaining empty seats. I was seated in 48J between two obese travellers and a young woman. As the obese lady needed 1.25 seats it was 12 hours of hell. The food trays were left for an hour which made it impossible to go to the bathroom or move around. Window shades were left open when it was sleep time, when I asked an attendant to request it to be closed I was informed ""sorry the man is asleep"". If a plane is going to be 100% full may I suggest they put on the amount of staff required to service the customers. On the first leg of my journey it was 45 mins before I got a glass of water, I rang the bell but no one replied. I was next to the window and man next to me had all his computer gear (large laptop) because his entertainment system did not work. At the last leg of my journey waiting to use the bathroom for a good ten minutes it was opened by an attendant, who removed the garbage bags so I could use it. Waste was overflowing in the restrooms. The worst was being locked into my seat by food trays, left for what seemed forever. The last experience I had like this was with a Quantas flight to Hong Kong, at least they apologised and explained that they were on staff member down. When are airlines going to realise that economy flyers are their bread and butter and we have a voice. I would rather pay another 15% and be treated as a guest and not an inconvenience.",2,28th September 2015,Australia

Dubai to Guangzhou on a Boeing 777 - plane virtually full, seat comfort not as good, seats narrow and 3x4x3 layout. Cabin crew efficient but hardly a smile. Flight on time,  but beware of Guangzhou airport, it's very slow to get through, large queues. Inbound from Guangzhou to Dubai 5 days later on Boeing 777, an older aircraft, again very full. Similar hard narrow seat, cabin crew seemed more interested in preening hair and chatting to each other than dealing with passengers. Food quite good, a better menu.

1608,"I recently flew Emirates from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai return, outward in economy and return in business. The difference is remarkable, in that their economy product is actually much better than business, notwithstanding the extra legroom, flat bed etc. The business product food has become unbearably overcomplicated and plain, and more familiar dishes would be much better. Its almost impossible from the menu descriptions to imagine what you will end up with. The age old problem of Emirates running out of preferred choice continues to be endemic to both classes. Wash bags have been axed on day flights in business class, magazines reduced considerably and the DXB lounge shabby (albeit work is ongoing). Queues for the toilets in the lounge are the norm and poor signposting leaves 10s of travelers lost in a daze. Service standards and crew standards are excellent as is the bottom line standard for Emirates but I can't help thinking that with a bit more focus on the business side, they could be back to where they should be - an industry benchmark.

The positives are a great entertainment system, good prices if the flight is booked at the right time but that's about it. Nowadays the meals have been scaled down and they must be using a cheap supplier as they have gone downhill on the culinary front -  none of the meals that I have had over the past couple of years have been very nice, especially when you compare the economy cabin food of Singapore and Malaysia Airlines both of whom were excellent. I also find that it depends on the crew if you get attention on your flight - on this flight both legs the crews were not at all interested in the passengers, no water runs were made, you had to ring continuously for drinks and then you were served by a surly crew.",5,26th September 2015,United Kingdom

The entertainment system is great : lots of choice and I do like watching the forward looking camera on take-off and landing. The food was good too. Problems are that seats are very narrow, so bumped the neighbour when eating, the food tray is huge - everything comes at the same time, so there is no room on the tray table for wine bottle or discarded containers.

Poor drinks and poor food. From Dubai to Geneva, everything was quicker and smoother, nice drinks, food, and a pleasant crew, including a great FA from Ile Maurice.

1613,"I was excited to be flying Emirates A380 business class for the first time. Chauffeur service top notch. Seats well-designed, but the film choice was poor. The onboard service was appalling. The problem being that there are so many people in business class in the upper deck of the 380 that the logistics of meal and drinks service go up the creek. Added to which the stewards/stewardesses act like automatons with no common sense and often poor or no English. One example of cock-eyed service is that my wife and I were sitting next to each other but service came from different aisles so she might be waiting patiently for her soup while I am waiting (less patiently) for my pudding. And her wine steward wasn’t permitted to fill up my glass and my aisle wine dispenser appeared 40 minutes later. Seemingly the only way to beat the system is to go to the bar at the back of the section but that would have requires all sorts of seat contortions. On a 7 hour evening flight you expect to get some decent sleep but there isn't enough sleep time when the airline's gambit is to stretch out drinks and dinner unendingly.

They did asked if you would like a drink, but you would have to ask exactly what was on offer as no more information was forthcoming. The worst part was the lack of water being offered on board. They came around twice to offer a cup of water and I found that I became very dehydrated. Even though there is a water cooler near the toilets (which I didn't know about at the time) it was almost impossible to get out of my seat as I was in the middle and my companion was asleep.

I was allocated a seat 24H which is an exit row seat, better legroom. I think a way of saying sorry for the misconnection that I had. IFE system is the best, food is generous. I'd rather less food but better quality. Avoid using Tourico Holidays, a company associated with Emirates, they cancelled my hotel reservation without even notifying me. The first cancellation, I was told to enter my physical address to avoid cancellation. I rebooked thru them the second time with physical address. Arriving in Barcelona hotel, shocked to be told that the hotel reservation is cancelled again, although my credit card was charged (apparently refunded), but no email to notify me that it has been cancelled by tourico.

The 10 across seating makes the aisles very narrow, a few airlines using this plane still have 9 seats across. Cabin staff did their job but lacked smiles and any form of friendliness. Overhead bins are meant for hand luggage so why do EK allow passengers to board with excessive cabin baggage? I saw one passenger with a small wheelie suitcase, two bags of duty free, a backpack and large handbag and she used up two overhead bins. I saw other passengers with similar amounts of hand luggage which is a bit unfair to other passengers. The passenger seated next to me was one of the last to board and had nowhere to put his hand luggage.

The flight took off almost 45 minutes late, the crew was professional and very pleasant, but that is the only thing positive to say about the whole trip. We landed in Dubai far away from the terminal. Emirates is running out of terminals and gates, so they land their planes some where in the massive DXB airport and then herd you in a bus. We actually got stuck inside the plane for another 20 minutes before disembarking to a bus. The bus trip to the terminal took another 25 minutes with frequent stops all over the airport.

Only gripe is that I had to wait 30 mins from being served my dinner to then waiting for the drinks trolley on our side - the result left me wanting to eat with wine but in the end had a cold meal with wine, but the wine selection in Economy is pretty good. Flight on a Boeing 777-300 from Dubai to Gatwick was not so nice, weird food as the flight was early morning, and a crew like they could not be bothered excepting one Korean staff. Asking for an eyeshade as the flight departed at 02:30 from 2 crew members got me okay I will get one, to we don’t carry them but I will look - in the end no come came to help or answer and I had no eyeshade. The Boeing 777 was not comfortable, not as bad as I was expecting but a far cry from Korean Air 777-300 I flew a few weeks earlier. The mileage points, after London to Seoul and Hong Kong to London, all I earned was 4400 air points! And the endless annoying pointless announcements in at least 2 languages but more if you are flying to a country with a differing language. I also found it quite arrogant how when you watch the flight map you must listen to the ramblings from the CEO on how amazing they are and the merits of the Emirates Ideals. Connecting in Dubai can add a lot of time to your trip, in this case about 5 hours compared with direct.

I have never traveled on an Emirates A330, so I had no idea what the seats would be like. On boarding the aircraft I was horrified to find that the seats were not even angle lie flat seats, in fact the seats could hardly recline more than a business class seat on a domestic route. Whilst I understand that airlines can and do change aircraft types on a route, how Emirates could change from private suites to a seat with limited recline and very small leg rest on an overnight services is beyond what I expect when paying a First Class fare.

Service onboard again not bad. Newer A380 aircraft with better IFE, but food was terrible. Early arrival into MEL and was out in 20 minutes of landing. ",6,11th September 2015,Australia

The flights were almost full. The service attentive and fast enough considering it was nearly full. Free drinks throughout the flights. Food was lovely, I am a big fan of Middle Eastern food and it is suitable for most Western palates. The in-flight entertainment system is miles better than British Airways, who I flew last time. The channel Relax TV was a nice new addition which I don't think they had last time.  The screens aren't great in daylight (they never are), but they are fine at night. The headphones and other bits you get are also a step up from other airlines.",3,11th September 2015,United Kingdom
1627,"Melbourne to Moscow Domodedovo via Dubai. Checkin in MEL handled by Dnata, staff aloof and unfriendly with attitude. Lounge good and good selection of food. First Flight on an older A380 showing signs of ageing. Eventhough Emirates boast that they have a multinational and multilingual cabin crew, most are more keen on how they look than be of service. IFE is excellent as always. Food is another story and is pretty bad now. A far cry from what is said in menu. The second leg the Purser was rude and made impression he would rather be somewhere else. All this said, Emirates is not bad and does fly out to many places and with seamless connections via DXB.",8,11th September 2015,Australia
1628,"I enjoyed Emirates inflight entertainment system. Flight attendants were polite and nice, food was excellent and tasty and seats were very comfortable. However I found that many lavatories had waste or even used papers and garbage on the floors and the flight attendants failed to clean it.",9,9th September 2015,United States
1629,"Flew Emirates from Houston to Dubai. I enjoyed the service and found the food tasted very good and was of high quality. The seats were fairly comfortable and the entertainment system was better than any other airline I have flown so far. One thing I did not like was that most lavatories I went to had toilet paper on the floor and trash in the bathroom, flight attendants had failed to clean the restrooms.",7,8th September 2015,United States
1630,"Disgusting service with Emirates. I am a rewards member and my flights were terrible. Being bumped from our reserved seats on both our return trips, even though my seats were confirmed. I complained on my first two flights and they assured me that my return flights were safe. Well they weren't. They bumped us again. I am disgusted at the Emirates attitude. I won't fly with them again. Choose a different carrier you will save yourself some grief.",1,7th September 2015,Australia
1631,"Out of Budapest and Warsaw Emirates have very old A330-200 planes which should have been retired years ago. In business class the AV system is old and the seats are not lie-flat and quite uncomfortable. I'm 6ft 2ins tall and my feet don't rest on the ground when I'm sitting in the seat. It's quite tough to sleep in these seats. In Dubai Emirates park the aircraft for these routes at the outer reaches of the airport, so a 20-25 minute bus ride from the terminal to the plane is normal when arriving and departing from Dubai. The last time I travelled they loaded the business class passengers on the bus after all the economy passengers had left. The ground staff then left us sitting with open doors in the bus terminal for about 15 minutes next to three other buses, all of which had their engines running while they waited for the last business passengers to arrive. Despite all of this, the onboard staff are lovely, and on this route they have apologised about the plane. Emirates seems to be operating a penny pinching service to Central Europe but advertising it on the basis that it's the same standard as the rest of the network. Overall if you can get a budget price for this route then it it may be worthwhile, but if you can avoid paying a premium to fly on these Emirates routes as you will be disappointed.",9,7th September 2015,United Arab Emirates
1632,"Cape Town to Manchester via Dubai in Emirates economy class. On time and great in-flight service. Enterainment system also one of the best. No issue with check in - all handled smoothly and good boarding at Cape Town. As others have said the Boeing 777 has narrower seats and aisles - not a problem for me, but does reduce the quality of the flight for some.  Food, I ordered special meals which came as requested and okay. In Dubai had to be transferred to and from the planes by bus which lengthens the transfer time. The airport has been built to take more people but seems to be bursting at the seams. Allow plenty of time if you are having to go on the train to and from terminals - it can be time consuming with lots of lifts, walks and then the train trip itself. Easy deplaning in Manchester and immigration and baggage claim there efficient.",10,7th September 2015,South Africa
1633,"Flew Emirates London Gatwick to Cape Town via Dubai. Good check in, good fast track and lounge. Boarding yet again a mess. Complaint to purser. Suite 1K, well trained on board staff and excellent purser. Food and drinks so so. Problem was family of 2 with 6 kids were running around and making a lot of noise. I'm not sure IATA allows these number of minor/children in such a small cabin. Talked to the purser who then talked to the father and things were a little better for a while. Could not sleep. Connecting in Dubai was a mess like the many other times I have transited there. Premium membership and fast track with this airline makes no difference at all, priority wise. Transit is a mess, problems with trains between terminals made us walk forever. A real unfortunate laugh. Second leg, with an 11 month old baby on board in the same cabin was crying non stop for 9 hours. The whole experience was a mess. Cabin staff apologetic but of no good to me. Bag on time but what two vile legs in first class.",5,6th September 2015,Belgium
1634,"I flew Emirates Johannesburg to Dubai, and guess the flight comfort depends on the type of aircraft and how many passengers are onboard. In my case I was quite lucky. No queues at the airport, security, immigration and check-in went very fast. Onboard there was enough legroom space, large interactive screen with an amazing selection of entertainment and movies. Internet WI-FI on board 500 MB for just 1$, decent meal. I was on an aisle and no one was sitting next to me and this added some comfort of course. Staff was courteous and prompt. I have to say that for an eight hours flight in Economy class this one wasn't bad at all, I'd say excellent actually.",7,6th September 2015,United Arab Emirates

Flight delayed by 2.5 hours due to late arrival from Bangkok so instead of departing at 9.25am, it wasn't until after midday. However, made up time in the air arriving at 4pm. Once in the air, service was excellent. Seated in 21K, in the last row of the front economy section, up against a toilet. Toilet was no bother though. With headphones, you hear nothing, and no smells. 3x4x3 seating with good pitch. Seat recline was great and I had no issues with reclining as no one behind. Good selection of entertainment options. Warm moist hand towels given upon departure. Menu with two choices. Food plentiful for this 2.5 hour flight. Flight was not full. Many seats spare. Seat beside me was free as it was for many seated on outside rows. Arrival into Christchurch was at a time when Emirates is the only international flight. So processing fast. Bags on belt within ten minutes of disembarking. From landing to airport exit was 15 minutes. Really good. Christchurch Airport is the best international airport in New Zealand. Apart from delay, it was a great flight.",6,5th September 2015,Australia

I boarded at 8am for this 2 hour flight, and when meal was served I was surprised to see a combo meal of curry, potato bhajee, cutlet, bread with jam and butter. This was like a lunch deal rather than breakfast. When I asked for the breakfast the staff replied they had only one type of meal. I can't understand why they served lunch instead of breakfast on such a quite early morning flight.",6,4th September 2015,Pakistan

They still failed to issue boarding passes for both legs. We had to pick up Dubai-Dhaka boarding passes at Dubai.

Cabin crew were friendly. Even though flying economy I was addressed by my name. The cabin was in good condition, space and legroom were good. The only thing I can criticize was that entertainment system was not functioning properly on one of the flights, but I slept most of the time and it didn't matter. It is a mystery why Emirates is not rated with 5 stars.",10,1st September 2015,Sweden

1643,"I first traveled with Emirates in March 2015 with my 10 year old son to Dubai. The Business Class service was appalling. The crew strutted around, barely taking orders and being completely inept. They served my son the wrong meal and did nothing to make him feel comfortable. They ended up losing my luggage on arrival, such that I was left with no clothes for the first 24 hours. I decided to give them a second chance and this time all 4 of us, (including my 10 year old and 5 year old), flew from NYC to Dubai and on to Bombay in mid August returning 3 days ago. Once again, the service on board was completely disorganized. On boarding, my 5 year old son's seatbelt had dried food all over it. I asked the steward to clean it and he handed me a warm towel and told me to do it myself. When I asked for my dessert to be given to my 5 year old instead of listening to me the stewardess said, ""You only get oreo cookies as dessert with a child's ""economy"" meal"". First off, I had paid $4000 per ticket for our Business Class tickets so the concept of ""child's economy meal"" didn't arise. I will never fly them again.",10,29th August 2015,United States
1644,"It's such a shame for the incompetence of their ground staff in johannesburg. I've never seen such shambles in my life. We were flying with our two 8 month old twins and 10 year old son. When we got to Johannesburg airport we already done online check in so just went to check out bags in. We waited right in front of the queue for a half hour because staff didn't know what they were doing then finally we got helped, it took the women another half hour to just check our bags in then she got all worried then told us she made a massive mistake, she put the previous passengers name tags on our bags so she had to change all the name tags. However, 2 bags were already sent down so she said she will go and change those tags. We quickly went to say goodbye to family and rushed through because we were running late due to the bag situation. While standing in the queue for ages at passport control one of the staff came and shouted at us because we holding the flight up I explained to her it was due to their incompetence we were late not ours - she rudely rushed us to the gate and saying one of our bags is at suspicious bags because there's a toy gun or aerosol can in it - neither of those items in it. When we got to the gate 15 mins before departure we were rudely spoken to by the other staff saying that we were kicked off. One of the staff members walked us to get our bags and out of departures lounge to rebook our flight. Then they realise that they put our tags on someone else's bags so two of our bags was missing, and other passengers wouldn't have their bags either. After 3 hrs of trying to locate our bags they finally decided that they think that our bags were on the flight to London. When rebooking our flight for the next day, they wanted to charge us an extra £500 per adult even though it was their fault we missed our flight. After speaking to the supervisor she said the only thing she can do to help us is only charging us a no show fee that was still £160. The next day got to the airport they said they've got us on the stand by 13:50 flight to Dubai so we will have 9 hrs transit in Dubai. When we got to Dubai we had to get our boarding passes for the next flight only to realise then that the staff at Johannesburg decided not to book our 2 infants on the next flight - luckily the staff at Dubai was helpful and helped us to book them on to the flight. The last straw was when our pushchair went missing due to Johannesburg staff incompetence again.",6,26th August 2015,United Kingdom

Catering was better from Dubai-Melbourne, some of the meal selections did not translate to tasty meals on the first leg. Staff on both legs were exceptional, very friendly, courteous and nothing was too much of a problem for them. The lounge facilities in Dublin could be improved, however the lounge in Dubai was wonderful. The chauffer service was a nice touch and took the hassle out of getting home from Melbourne Airport. The only other criticism beyond the food (which is a small one) is that the flight display didn't work on the Dubai - Melbourne leg. Would highly recommend business class with this airline.",9,26th August 2015,Australia

1647,I really want to like Emirates so much but the variable nature of their service just makes the love difficult to give. It's the whole experience from check in at Sydney (the agent was very grumpy about my baggage being 4kgs over and did not like being told that as a Qantas FF I was well within my allowance) to onboard where the crew were nice but just lacked polish. It's a case of Emirates having expanded so swiftly that their staffing standards are haphazard. Small things such as bags with linen from the crew rest area being dumped at the back of the main deck - Just not a good look. Emirates fly from Sydney to where I need to get to globally but just make it difficult to love them.,1,24th August 2015,Australia
1648,"We left Heathrow at 10.15pm, due to arrive in Dubai around 8am, so this is an overnight flight as I see it. So I didn't understand the logic of serving us a full dinner an hour into the flight and then breakfast 2 hours before landing. The cabin lights only went off for about an hour between these times, so overall it was almost impossible to sleep. When we checked in online we (couple with toddler son) were not given 3 seats together but the staff on the ground at LHR managed to talk someone into moving so we ended up together. Service on board was okay, but not up to the standards I have experienced in the past. Overall though, I cannot recommend this airline and flight for this route - if you are staying in Dubai you have had no chance to sleep and therefore you are going to have to manage 2 days awake in a row and probably not have a chance to enjoy your day in Dubai.",2,23rd August 2015,New Zealand
1649,"Boarding was fine but we were standing around with no info given as to why we weren't moving. Left 20 odd minutes late but flight time to Melbourne was an hour short so that was good. Emirates is a really good airline for flying with children. But overall I was underwhelmed with the service - indeed it seems to be getting worse each time I fly this airline. Food delivery is a bit erratic in terms of timing, and the steward serving hot drinks passed us by twice. Going to Auckland it was announced we were descending. We hadn't received NZ arrival cards, which are rather long to fill out, so I asked a passing steward. He seemed surprised by the request and I pointed out that everyone else would need one too. So a few minutes later he came round with some - but nowhere near enough for everyone so he had to go back and get some more. Then they got grumpy with us for having a tray table down (to fill it out) while we were in descent. This was really poor - surely handing out landing cards is a pretty basic function - they were handed out straight away going to Melbourne. We had breakfast twice - just before landing in Melbourne and again after taking off and it was pretty much the same both times. Bad luck if you don't like mushrooms or baked beans. Overall disappointing and, if going to Europe again, I will look for other options.",7,23rd August 2015,New Zealand

1651,"London Heathrow to DXB in Business Class on the A380. If business class was purely about the comfort of seating and the layout I would give Emirates 10/10. However, I witnessed a very different picture then to my expectations. Having flown Qatar airways throughout the years even on a Bahrain to Dubai flight via Doha, I was accustomed to high standards of service. The service from the crew was a letdown. I asked for a fruit platter and I was told by the crew that they would have to check whether they even have it available. I mean ridiculous that you would not have this to be served to a passenger twice. Frustrating was the fact that the crew did not even come back to tell me through out the whole flight that they did not have fruit plate available, which I think he assumed I forgot. Each and every time I requested something I had to typically wait longer then a passenger flying economy.  I even did not garner a response from the crew that they were unable to carter to my request or an apology for the same. The food itself was not up to the exquisite taste we come to associate with this travel. Obviously I would not know better because I was not able to try another statement dish. I have had better, personal and quicker service in A380 economy where a crew is bound to serve more then 300-400 passengers. I do think I would appreciate a more personal response and attention then a standard we are sorry to hear of your inconvenience and regret the same.  I am not going to risk that next trip unless I actually see an effort on part of the airline to make amends for its lackluster performance.",10,19th August 2015,Bahrain

Lounge in T3/B is ugly, but food was ok. Showers too small, much smaller than at T3/A. Boarding to KIX completely chaotic.

The Aircraft was fine, relatively new and everything worked well with a friendly crew. However the flight to Colombo via Malé was on a 777-300 (NON ER) which was very tired and featured the old ptv screens which were half broken.

As theres nothing much to shop or dine, I decided just to wait at the gate and talk to the EK crews. (The aircraft layover in SIN was 1.5 hours before continuing to Dubai). The crews were friendly and I felt welcomed for the journey. We took off 18 mins later than schedule. It was a 7 hour night flight.

The seat is very comfortable and the crew provided us with a mattress to make it even better for sleeping. There is plenty of storage and the bar next to the seat is a nice touch. The main bar at the back of the upper floor is great idea for socializing. Flight from Dubai to LHR was on the older A380 and it was showing its age. The seat was not as nice and quite dirty in some parts. The crew were friendly and selection of drinks was great. I am vegetarian and I was struggling to find anything on the menu.

At breakfast time when everyone else is eating a nice cheese omelette with hash browns and mushrooms, I am given some horrendous dish of tasteless potatoes.

My disappointment on my four flights were customer service or the lack thereof, and I am afraid the ultimate criticism - it was no different to being in Economy. On each flight amenity bags were quickly distributed to men, despite waiting patiently I always had to ask. On an 8 hour evening flight I was told, ""we don't hand these out on evening flights."" The menu invites you to choose what tea or coffee you would like. But in reality there is no choice, just like in Economy two stewards come around with flasks of tea and coffee. Tray table is pulled out on the hour, breakfast arrives 20 mins later, coffee follows after 10 mins, and the refill never came. Within the cabin depending on which side your seat was on you visibly had a different experience. I could see post take off drinks being served, but I was never offered one. It becomes tiring to keep buzzing them to receive a minimum service. I have often mocked the likes of Virgin for their automated approach to customer service - but at least you all receive the same service, it is not the luck of the draw.

1664,"Emirates is not your ordinary airline, in that it has one of the most extravagantly decorated cabins, from the LED stars to the fancy bathrooms to how their IFE works. It's also worth noting that they seem to fly the plane at maximum operating speeds at all times. It's a nice thought that we matter more than fuel savings. Food was great, seats weren't superb, and cabin service was satisfactory. Being a frequent flyer on Cathay Pacific, I can say that they provide far better service in terms of the cabin crew and frequency of meals. IFE had a very wide suggestion, and worked very smoothly, it's nice of them to leave a volume setting button on the remote even when announcements are being made. Unfortunately Emirates really falls short on seat comfort. I love the 777, it's great, but a 3-4-3 seat configuration is not. The seats felt narrow and sort of claustrophobic.

Absolutely terrible. Now I'm not suggesting for a moment my kids aren't picky when it comes to food, but this was terrible. Pasta that was cooked days ago and reheated. Well they tried to reheat. It was either was frozen or cold. The bread was also terrible. The cabin crew on the first leg were great and up to Paris also great but on the flight home from Dubai to Sydney.

LGW to Dubai was on Airbus A380 - comfortable seats (although the IFE wasn't working on my seat which was disappointing and it wasn't rectified by crew even though I asked them twice). Food quality was good and generous. Transit at Dubai was a bit long winded having to change terminals but fine as it was a short transfer time. Dubai to Male was very comfortable - service was marginally better on this leg. Return journey, Male to Dubai again on B777 (which was noisy) but again comfortable with good service. Breakfast was good in terms of quality. Dubai to LGW - transit was ok, although the boarding gate was too small for the number of passengers - no where to sit. Flight was pleasant with very good service, comfortable seats, quiet aircraft, IFE and good quality meals. Overall - better aircraft, service and value for money than European carriers. Only downside was transit at Dubai which is a bit of trek.",9,6th August 2015,United Kingdom
1670,"I flew Emirates for my first time recently. Having read reviews talking about how great they are and reviews about how cramped their 777 is, I was sceptical. My flight was quite cheap to book ($~650USD). Be warned however, that if you are not flying to or from the US, luggage rules are stricter. If you fly to/from the US, you receive 2 x 20kg bags, otherwise, it is 30kg total. This forced me to spend $350USD on an extra 5kg of luggage, which was quite a hassle. Despite the availability of business class seats, you can only upgrade with points, not cash. The flight was fine, the flight attendants are very sweet and helpful, and the food was some of the best I've had. However - food and drink service takes at least an hour to be delivered, leaving many people finishing their meals before receiving a drink. The seat was pretty standard, I had an empty one next to me, which helped. An inch in each direction would be great. Emirates saved money on the 777 by fitting 10 seats across instead of the usual 9, this leaves very small walkways, and tightens the seats up a bit. However, I'm 6'3"" and didn't have too much trouble. Just be aware, the seats aren't anything to write home about. The ICE entertainment system was good, but a bit jumpy and laggy. Otherwise, ok selection of movies. Unfortunately, my flight didn't have WiFi installed yet. Lastly, the scheduling of the flights seems silly, the Dubai airport is flooded with people at midnight. Emirates should rethink their scheduling system.",3,3rd August 2015,United States
1671,"I have become a loyal Emirates traveller over the past year with short hops in and out of Saudi Arabia on a regular basis and retained Gold status. However, this flight reminded me why I do not rate Emirates for longer haul. Flight was a hour late leaving due to slow loading of cargo and then we missed our take off slot. Drink service came 1.5 hours after take off and food started 1 hour later - but took nearly 1.5 hours to get out all courses. By this time we were 2/3rds of the way into the flight (so if we had wanted to sleep forget it) and by Dubai time (my starting point) it was gone 4pm. Food was a starter of tiny piece of smoked duck, mains were something with rice and since there were a lot on non-Chinese on the flight I think in business class there should have been another non-rice choice. My main was two tiny bits of skin covered in tasteless red gunge which was supposed to be sweet and sour chicken plus something that once may have have been pak choi but was so waterlogged it clearly had drowned weeks ago. Totally inedible. About an hour later they offered us a snack - it was barely an hour since lunch - it all smelled awful and what I saw of it was not worth touching. Sorry, Emirates, next time I fly to the Far East I will check out Qatar and will remain loyal as before to BA for London/Europe/States despite their old planes.",6,3rd August 2015,United Arab Emirates
1672,"The 2nd leg of my wife's and my return flight from the Seychelles and a discounted upgrade into business class. Apart from relatively comfortable and spacey seating, nothing special. Friendly staff, but the three-course meal was served and cleared much too quickly, forcing us to eat our food much faster than we would have in economy, and making the beginning of the flight not relaxing at all. The food itself was ok for business, but not much better than in economy. Entertainment great as always. After all - only the seating justified the upgrade.",9,2nd August 2015,Germany
1673,"Overall we found the experience disappointing. The seats were average, the WiFi was fine (10mb for free) the entertainment system had a good variety of programs, the food was ordinary and the service was indifferent (on our return flight one of the stewardess's was incredibly rude) although the ground staff in Dubai were fantastic. This is the 5th time we have flown this route and have had far better experiences with other airlines (Singapore, Malaysian, JAL and Saudi)",1,2nd August 2015,Australia
1674,"Flight from Cape Town was late into Dubai due to traffic parked at a different terminal to the connecting flight but at a remote spot. Had to use stairs, then a 15 minute bus ride then a train ride into chaotic terminal 3 with no help at all to get to the gate. At least 20 on the arriving flight had to run for their lives to get to our gate on time. Was exhausted and not even a minute to have a drink in the lounge. The A380 great after the 777. At Heathrow waited an hour at the carousel for the luggage. No help from any Emirates staff only one bag out of three had been loaded in Dubai. They should have sent someone to the baggage reclaim to advise as there were quite a few people who had no baggage. When we got through immigration the Emirates car had left us stranded. On the return the Dubai leg was good but a repeat of the first leg the Cape Town flight parked miles away from terminal 3 and boarding was total chaos. Lugging your overnight bags up stairs I thought went out in the 60's. No amenity bags on the Heathrow - Dubai was told that if the flight is under 7 hours and in Daylight that's the new policy despite the fact you paid a premium for the ticket. I think Emirates has grown way too big to cope or care about their customers and they can't cope. Transfers between terminals in Dubai are a most unpleasant experience.",10,28th July 2015,South Africa
1675,"Great flight from JFK to Milan. The aircraft is new and roomy. Lots of great entertainment to watch on the widescreen seat monitors. Seats were very comfortable. We were seated by the galley, which unfortunately, was a little noisy and was hard to sleep, but other than that, I can't wait to fly Emirates again. One of the better airlines I've been on. Our return flight home a couple weeks later was also a really good experience. Thumbs up to Emirates! (at least to this particular plane and route).",10,28th July 2015,United States
1676,"All was fine: ground services, cabin crew, food and beverages. The seat was very comfortable and the ICE system had  a great selection of movies and other live programs. The cabin was very silent and the WiFi network worked fine. ",10,28th July 2015,Italy
1677,"The flight was delayed in Vienna. After boarding, I felt very cold due to the A/C being turned to extremely cold. I was told that the WiFi would work on this flight, however, the truth is that it didn't work. When I arrived in DXB, I had to pass through another Security Gate to transfer. The ground staff worked so ineffectively that there was a very long queue. The airport was full of people and it was very hard for me to get to my boarding gate. The second flight was from DXB to CAN. When boarding, I found that there was water leaking from the luggage rack. No air hostess came to deal with it. ",10,28th July 2015,China
1678,"The service provided by the cabin crew was excellent, escorted to our suites, individually addressed by name. The suites are excellent and the facilities great, especially the ICE entertainment. The shower is out of this world, we both had three each. The business class bar has a good selection of drinks and snacks, the bar staff being particularly friendly. The first class bar is self serving again wth snacks and rolls,and a great selection of spirits. Not forgetting the dining, silver service with an option to eat at our own convenience. Choice of food excellent, accompanying wine and champagne first class. ",9,28th July 2015,United Kingdom
1679,"Delayed departure of 24 hours due to a broken fuel gauge on 380, however given 2 separate £10 meal vouchers in the first 5 hours at the airport and then taken to 4 star hotel and again given Dinner and breakfast at the hotel. Flight to Dubai, excellent entertainment but slow inefficient service with only one stewardess per trolley resulting in trolley being left in aisle if she had to go and get something from galley. Due to travelling with a school group that had to travel together onward flight to Delhi necessitated a further 24 hour stopover in Dubai but at least in a decent Hotel. Night flight to Delhi on 777 with much better service. Entertainment system good but not to the standard as on 380. Return flights same story, quick efficient service on 777 slow and inefficient on 380.",2,27th July 2015,United Kingdom
1680,"Competitively priced. A380 significantly better on comfort and service than B777. B777 issues: No drinks served for three hours, inefficient and desperately slow food services, no non Halal meat option, frugal with alcohol and some stewards were rude. Emirates music now confined just to exit of plane thankfully! Positives - painless and efficient transfer at DXB, video on demand allows you to skip advertising at beginning, smooth flight and landing.",3,27th July 2015,United Kingdom
1681,"This was my first time trying Fly Emirates and I was disappointed. When we first arrived the plane's AC was off and everyone was hot, not to mention a 1 hour delay for departure. The cabin staff were not cooperating at all. My mother needed help with baggage and the hostess told her to do it herself. We ordered water and tea countless times until they finally responded, the inflight entertainment in my opinion is not good. There wasn't enough variety in the choice of food. When we bought the tickets they advertised it as a plane that has WiFi, which was not the case. The plane was old, the seats were tiny and not comfortable at all. The cabin manager was very helpful though and listened to our complaints and was one of the few reliable people in the staff. Definitely not going to try it again.",8,25th July 2015,United Arab Emirates
1682,"The Emirates 777 is a disappointment compared to it's A380 services. The interior was somewhat dated and tired and the entertainment system was not intuitive for the first time user and difficult to navigate once the general layout became obvious. The programs available were generally sufficient. Emirates looks after the kids well, with our youngest receiving special attention when she got on board and the gift she received was far more imaginative than the usual set of crayons and a colouring book that most airlines go for. The kids meals was also a dedicated meal rather than an adult meal with a few tweaks, though it would be nice to see some healthier options available for kids meals. The headset provided actually fit our daughter. It's these small touches that make travelling with kids easier. The seats were roomy in width and pitch and the flight to FRA was only a third full so we had plenty of room to spread out. Cabin service was generally of a high standard and meals provided were one decent and edible meal and a snack. I would fly with Emirates again, but at this stage I'm not sure what the fuss is about.",2,22nd July 2015,Australia
1683,"We were disappointed with our recent Emirates flight. On our return from Paris were were informed of a 6 hour delay but without any explanation. During the delay were were provided with a voucher for one drink and one cake! When we eventually boarded it took over two hours to get a meal let alone a drink. My partner was on a special diet and his meal was put in front of him 90 minutes before mine. 4 hours later he still had the tray in front of him. When the food does arrive it's sub standard with yet another annoying snack box containing hard breads and a sweet sticky chilli sauce. Yes, the aircraft are new and the IFE ok but the attitude of the cabin crew doesn't match. They appear surly and unsmiling as if us paying passengers are an inconvenience. We encountered the same issues with the cabin crew on our outward flight. All in all a very disappointing experience.",2,21st July 2015,Australia
1684,"We are an Australian family of four, that just returned after spending a month in Europe. We booked our travel with Emirates, travelling Brisbane, Barcelona, Paris, London, Dubai and return. The preference for our seating was booked by our travel agent for the window seats in the left rear from rows 46-49. However, on every sector except from London to Dubai, the seats were changed in every instance to those in the middle - four of us! I telephoned the booking offices at each location, who refused to help, then at the check in counter at each airport who were very unhelpful. It was a long journey which we had to endure. I found almost all of their staff, be it Cabin Crew or Counter Staff to be very robotic in their attitude. No customer service at all. No friendly disposition, no making eye contact and overall they all looked very tired. The food provided on the aircraft was more than ample. However, this is not enough to sway me to fly with them again. I did the right thing, booked our trip with them months in advance of our travel, preference of seats and very disappointed at their lack of empathy that we were travelling long distances and no courtesy in endeavouring to help. Won't be flying Emirates again!",9,21st July 2015,Australia
1685,"We left Kuala Lumpur on time on our flight to DXB. The aircraft was slightly cold, and had no wifi. As it was night time most went to sleep, I went to sleep for a few hours. There was not the best choice of programmes, and the aircraft was one of the older ones. The meal was good and the cabin staff were nice. ",3,20th July 2015,United Kingdom
1686,"The seats were comfortable, food edible and service very good, with the exception of one flight attendant. We were sitting near the galley and were fed up with his whingeing to the other cabin crew. He practically threw a drink at me and sneered at an elderly passenger's requests. He really stood out for all the wrong reasons as the rest of Emirates crew were great. ",8,19th July 2015,Australia
1687,Narrow seats with very little legroom. The staff were rude and with an awful attitude. Free food obviously. ICE was not what I expected. My fingers were almost broken trying to click on screen. The Boeing 777-300ers some brand new still seemed jaded. As for DXB I will return to European hubs. Disappointed my first time. Expected so much more. The staff badly need to change their attitude.,6,18th July 2015,Ireland
1688,"Last month, I traveled from JFK in New York to Milan, Italy. I only have good things to say about my experience. First of all, the plane was huge and the seats were comfortable. The food was great, the staff were helpful. There was a huge selection of free movies and music to watch and listen to during my flight. I also happened to leave my handbag on the plane on my way to Milan and I was sure that I wouldn't get it back, but as I was checking in my luggage, a flight attendant approached me with my handbag, asking if it was mine. I was pleasantly surprised. My comment is that on my flights to Milan and back, the wifi and internet did not work at all, but the movies, games, and music on the TV screens worked perfectly, so this didn't impact my experience that much.

1690,"I was onboard EK345 on 1/7/2015 from KLIA to Dubai, departing at 9.30 am (Malaysian Time). Emirates has generally good service but I must say that the service provided by staff will supercede all other aspects. I believe a customer may forget if the landing was not smooth, the food was delayed or not to required taste, the departure slightly delayed etc etc. A rude or arrogant staff member however will be remembered and customers may reconsider their travel experience with the said airline. Again, I will rate Emirates to have given my family and I fairly good service. But I was very much upset with one of the cabin crew. I have observed harsh tones in dealing with customers in particular those elderly and who may not be proficient in English. ",5,15th July 2015,Malaysia
1691,"London Gatwick to Shanghai via Dubai on 29th of June. First flight on A380 was a smooth, comfortable flight. Cabin serice was good and entertainment options impressive. After a long 9 hour layover in DXB, we boarded a Boeing 777-300ER to PVG,  and service didn't fail to impress. Cabin crew were consistent with service, this is rare on DXB-Asia flights I have exerienced in the past. The flight was a bit cold, bring a jumper for Boeing 777-300ER flights because my returning flight from PVG-DXB on 13th July was also quite chilly. Flight from DXB to LGW was also good, however this A380 hadn't been refurbished as some of the others have, so the monitors were quite slow to respond to touch commands which was annoying. Overall 4 good flights, check in on the ground is good. I briefly used the wi fi on DXB-LGW flight but it was only 10mb free before they charge, it seemed quite good from what I could see.",7,14th July 2015,United Kingdom

Service has declined since my first flight with them and I have been flying with Emirates once a year since 2010. Really disappointed.",9,13th July 2015,Singapore
1693,"Brilliant flight as always and Emirates is known for its very comfortable flights. However, I truly feel that Emirates's standards have notched down a bit as the cabin crew are not that responsive to economy class passengers. Moreover, I had to ask for a glass of water about 5 times which is unacceptable according to Emirates standards. I am a frequent traveller of Emirates but this was not a good experience in terms of service provided. On the positive side, the seats were extremely comfortable and inflight entertainment was superb with movies from all over the world and very fine podcasts!",10,12th July 2015,United Arab Emirates
1694,"This was without question the worst Business Class flight I've ever undertaken in my life. Flight was QF8765 a code-shared flight operated by Emirates on 28 June 2015. Flying with Emirates can be a hit or miss affair based on our experiences, with the inflight service either being excellent or completely sub-standard. In this case it was the worst flight ever in terms of customer service, meals availability, and in-flight entertainment not functioning. Our flight attendant was just outrightly rude and lazy, with almost every request being met with an exasperated expression and blunt responses. It honestly felt like we were an inconvenience just being on her plane. This terrible service being followed by incomplete catering. We were offered only one meal from the menu, and there was no desserts, coffee or chocolates. The catering was terrible on this flight, however no apologies from our awful flight attendant. I had to argue with the flight attendant when she attempted to serve my teenage son with a children's meal (despite him being adult sized and holding a full adult Business class ticket). Inflight entertainment was not functioning correctly with mine and several other screens not working. We reported it to our disinterested flight attendant who said they would reset the system, however this never occurred. Upon leaving the aircraft at Sydney I reported the incidents to an Emirates ground staff CSO who was on the aero bridge. We never heard from him or had any follow-up from Emirates at Sydney. We wrote to Emirates, however with any correspondence to the complaints / complements team at Emirates there was no reply.",6,10th July 2015,Australia
1695,"Delayed by 10 hrs found out accidentally after check-in when I noticed the boarding pass of the connecting flight showing 19.50 instead of 09.50 (initially thought it was a misprint). No active QF communication as they got my email and mobile number or why on earth did they not delay my flight to Dubai for 10 hours. Later I found out passengers booked under EK flight numbers were reshuffled to other EK connecting flights, passengers under Qantas had to see the QF counter in Dubai (see below). Flight service was extremely poor from FRA to Dubai, took 3 hrs to finish service, whole seat rows were forgotten to service and they could not fix this for 20 minutes (usually they do this instantly). Drinks were not delivered with the meal but well after, EK service has gone dramatically downhill. On arrival in Dubai plane was parked on roll field and we had the longest air field tour ever. It took 20 minutes in a barely air-conditioned bus with 38 degree outside temperature to arrive. Once the building was reached a big queue on incoming security check. Some passengers on tight connections got very nervous and I doubt they made it. Trying to find a QF counter at Dubai airport was a nightmare as the maze at this airport is indeed amazing. It took me 45 to get to the right concourse after 4 stops at info counters as no relevant signs exist. Some people told me it took them 2 hrs to get there from touchdown. Another 15 minutes to find the right exit and shuttle stop, just missed a shuttle to the express hotel - next one was only 30 minutes later. So from touchdown to arriving at the hotel nearby took 2.5-3 hrs and I walked about just short of 2km including all the extra steps trying to find the counter way. After 6 hrs or so I tried to make my way to the shuttle but long queue and not enough seats and full so had to push the hotel to organise quicker returns as a few groups were waiting also. At the same time the flight was pulled forward some 40 minutes so for those relying on the boarding pass time printed on the boarding pass was very tight, although it did not matter as another delay. Service on the Dubai–Sydney sector was good apart from the annoying new approach to service where everything is given separately, i.e. cutlery one pass, tablet, main meal, desert and drinks – wonder who came up with that stupid idea? This whole experience was quite amazing and makes you realise how tricky things can get and thinking about passengers who are not able to easily walk about 2 kms or do not speak English well enough to follow the maze of instructions to even get to a Qantas counter – they would have had no chance and it makes you realise how easy a connecting flight through e.g. Singapore on the same airline is.",10,10th July 2015,Australia
1696,"WAW to TPE and back. Journey was pretty good. I was little bit upset about DXB airport terminal 3. Maybe it was modern and clean, however ""duty free"" prices had nothing in common with ""duty free"". Good thing is that Emirates provides a free-meal coupon if stopover lasts more then few hours. During all flights the crew was very kind and professional, I was satisfied with their service. Meals were above average. Only one thing really suprised me  was the entertainment system in A330 flying DXB to WAW. Emirates is really proud of its system, but in that plane there were just few channels to choose instead of whole system. Moreover, quality of monitors was far from good. Very surprising. Emirates biggest strengths are luggage weight limitations, punctuality and professional staff. ",9,9th July 2015,Poland
1697,"Generally good service, but my screen console wasn’t working. I told the hostess who said she would reboot the screen. Twenty minutes later after nothing had happenedI told another hostess who said exactly the same thing. Neither returned to check if the screen was working. The third hostess I asked if I could move to another seat with a working entertainment console. This was arranged but should have been done much earlier on when I told them it wasn’t working. I don’t think the quality of their entertainment consoles are that good, something I have noticed on other flights with them. This experience confirmed that. The seat pitch seems particularly narrow. If you drop something on the floor you can forget about trying to pick it up. I'll fly the whole way with Qantas next time.",8,9th July 2015,Australia
1698,"Bangkok to Dubai, 4 July, EK373, A380 was as expected and as usual there was a good offering of inflight entertainment choices. The inflight service was some of the worst I have experienced and my expectations are pretty low! Nearly 2.5 hours until even a glass of water was offered. I would rather they ditched the hot towels and handed out a bottle of water at the beginning of the flight if they are incapable of providing a glass of water within a hour of take off. Crew were largely invisible and on the odd occasion one would scurry down the aisle avoiding all eye contact with passengers. The only visible crew member spent most the flight speaking to friends or family in row 45. All service requests in our section ignored and a number of other frustrated passengers mystified as to what was going on. Plane arrived on time but to a stand well away from the terminal. Buses, delays and a transfer that felt like we were driving from Abu Dhabi to Dubai.",1,9th July 2015,Ireland
1699,"Very efficient booking and check in. Very good value for the money. All flights on time and excellent entertainment choices inflight. Meals were ok, not great.

1700,Flights on time. For dinner the last meal available had something that I was intolerant of. They managed to find me a crew meal that saved the day. What was strange was the timing of the meals. Dinner was served about 5pm departure time. Breakfast was about 5am departure time. My guess that this enabled the service of a snack and a light meal on the 6 and 10 hours sectors. Personally i'd rather have dinner at 7 on the short sector. Breakfast much later on the long sector to try to get a sleep. Serving a snack later would be enough.,3,8th July 2015,Australia
1701,"After several Economy and Business flights on Emirates we'd accrued enough Skywards points to upgrade our return flight to First class. Emirates First class on the A380 is excellent, you get your own private cabin with closing doors. The seat is massive and very comfortable. There's a tablet remote control so you can adjust your seat into any position or lie-flat and control the TV etc. The cabin is well designed with lots of flat surfaces and a big pull out table/desk. There's a mattress and pillow behind your seat and you are bombarded with free gifts from Bvlgari, pyjamas, slippers, writing kit etc. The cabin manager will greet you and explain how to operate all the toys in your cabin and as the cabin wasn't full we virtually had our own hostess who appeared from nowhere every time you opened you doors. The food is excellent and served to order with plenty of well aged spirits, Dom Perignon, wines and soft drinks. This cabin doesn't have toilet cubicles it has bathrooms with a shower! There's also a self service bar near the bathrooms or you can use the bar at the rear of Business class. This was 8 hours of pure luxury although I would never pay for it as it's double the price of Business class which is also excellent on the A380.",2,8th July 2015,United Kingdom
1702,Flights on time. Arrived in Dubai and stopped a good way from from the terminal. The flight from Dubai tracked through the South of Jordan to about Cairo and then to Madrid.

This flight was excellent as it was only half full and I had a whole row of 4 seats to myself. The seats in economy are arranged 3-4-3 and quite comfortable, there was no one behind so I could recline my seat. ICE entertainment was very good but not the latest version as on the A380. The food was OK and they were generous with the drinks making several runs with the trollies during the flight and picking up litter. Unfortunately this is not always the case with Emirates, I've been on full flights with bad crew who are stingy with the drinks, slow with the food then leave your tray for 2 hours so you can't leave your seat, all deliberate tactics because they can't be bothered to deal with a full flight, over 300 people.",8,7th July 2015,United Kingdom
1704,"BRU-DXB on Boeing 777-300 in Business class. The check in was good,  and you get a fast pass through security and passports. They share a lounge with other airlines but it was ok with nice views over the runway.

The food choices were good, good Moet champagne and a lot of drinks options with good aged spirits. The seats are is 2-3-2 and we always try to prebook 2 together by the window. ICE entertainment system is excellent, probably the best in the air, and very good noise cancelling headphones. The seat is comfortable with a perfect preset recline position but you can adjust it how you want or lie-flat. They provide a mattress if you want to sleep. DXB-BKK on the A380. The Business cabin is nearly all the top deck apart from 3 rows of First in the front. The seat arrangement is staggered so if you want to sit together your only choice is in the middle so you won't get a window seat. However these seats are surrounded by furniture so you're away from the aisle so very cosy. The service was excellent and the staff seemed happy to serve. The seat is different but just as comfortable and of course lie-flat. It has the same ICE system. However the beauty of the A380 is the bar or inflight lounge with it's long, comfy seats and plenty of standing area. Both flights were on time and you get a fast pass to avoid the long queues at passports in BKK and your bags have priority so will be out before you. And Emirates provide a free chauffeur service into Bangkok, we had a nice Mercedes.",4,7th July 2015,United Kingdom
1705,"This was my first flight on the new Emirates A380. We flew Heathrow to Dubai in economy class (then on 777 to Delhi). I've flown on Emirates 777 in economy many times which is probably the best but on the A380 it's another level. My son and I sat in the back row of 4 seats in the front section, the flight wasn't full so we had all 4 seats to ourselves, a bonus. However the seats are wider with more leg room than on 777. The ICE entertainment system is excellent with over 100 movies for a 7 hour flight and the screen is big. The headphones are ok but I recommend taking your own to block out all noise. The service was excellent, maybe because it wasn't a full flight, and the food was good and they were quick with the drinks and made several drinks run throughout the flight. The next leg to Delhi was a 777 so I prebooked the 2 seats together at the back of the plane but when we went to the gate to board we were upgraded to business class, probably because the flight was full or overbooked but another welcome bonus. The business cabin is spacious with seat arrangement 2-3-2, we were in 2 of the middle 3. The seats are cocoon, lie-flat style so I slept this leg but my son stayed awake and enjoyed the Hennessey XO.",10,6th July 2015,United Kingdom

Captain very good at communicating flight status and arrival information. Aircraft was quite new and well kept. Children's meals arrived before others and with suitable choices. Our meals ok but nothing special. Movie selection was a little disappointing compared to previous Emirates flights. I struggled to find something decent to watch. Unfortunately at DXB aircraft was parked ages away from the terminal, which meant a 20 min bus ride. Overall, a pretty good experience but still issues with making the Qantas-Emirates interaction feel seamless, especially at check-in and transit.",8,4th July 2015,Egypt
1709,Our flight (EK028) from Glasgow at about 2 left on the dot. The inflight entertainment was great and the meals were excellent! The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. Drinks service were often. The seat was extremely comfy and the 7.5 hour flight whizzed by! As we arrived at peak time in Dubai we had to wait a bit. (About 20mins). The following flight (SIN-DXB) was about 3 am and was an Airbus 380-800. We got to the gate as it said gate closing athough we didn't leave for another 30mins. We got served breakfast onboard. The flight was cold at the beginning then started to warm up. We had better inflight intertainment than the first flight we arrived in Singapore at about 15.00 (+5hrs from DXB),5,3rd July 2015,Cyprus
1710,"It was my first time on Emirates Business Class and the experience was really good. The cabin crew were quite friendly and made me feel comfortable. The seat was good with numerous features and was surprised to see the big collection of movies. The meal was pleasing - I had pre-ordered a seafood platter, the dessert was good .The fast track security check coupons were useful at the airport.",8,3rd July 2015,Italy
1711,"While I did get my value for money, I wouldn't consider flying Emirates again. Ground service at Sydney airport was ok. Check-in was quick and smooth. However, at the gate staff were generally unfriendly and quick to dismiss people. The person managing the gate seemed tired and angry at customers. The plane was clean and quite spacious. The seats were comfortable and the inflight entertainment was very good. There was a very large selection of entertainment. However, the flight was significantly let down by the crew. When boarding, the flight attendant at the door sent me down the wrong aisle. When serving the hot towels, the flight attendant literally threw a towel at me. During the meal service, the flight attendant gave me the wrong order. Instead, she gave me my seatmate's order (and gave my seatmate my order). Additionally during the drinks service, the flight attendant seem bothered when I asked what tea they were offering. Ultimately I thought the crew were inexperienced, tired and annoyed. This was my first flight with Emirates, and it unfortunately has given me a bad impressions of the airline.",1,2nd July 2015,Australia
1712,"A very bad journey. We took flight from Glasgow to Dubai, when we arrived to Dubai airport our boarding pass was taken away by one of the Emirates staff and gave us new boarding pass without any information given - when we asked them, we have been told that our connecting flight from Dubai to Delhi has been cancelled. The cabin crew on flight were fantastic.",1,29th June 2015,United Kingdom
1713,"Our flight to Dubai was delayed by 2 hours and Emirates didn't seem to care. We had one notification that our flight will delayed by 2 hours and not a word since. Staff appeared not experienced, disinterested and rather tired to serve. The cabin looked outdated and they run out of specific food although we were seated towards front of the aircraft. When our luggage was misplaced at Dubai airport, nobody had a clue what happened to it or where should we go. Waiting with 3 kids at the airport for over 2 hours wasn't fun. ",8,29th June 2015,United Kingdom
1714,"Travelled on this very busy sector in middle of June 2015. The Check in process was smooth and I was given an easy access since was carrying an infant. I pre booked the seats and had booked for a bassinet seat and was duly accorded. Security and Immigration was smooth and fast. Aircraft seemed a little old but was clean. Seats were very narrow and had a limited pitch. However on account of us having a Bassinet seat got enough leg room for this short haul flight. The service was efficient, they took the drinks trolley thrice and served guests each time. The selection was food. Food was good but seemed very inadequate for a full grown adult like me. Departure and arrival timings were perfect. Inflight ICE System was good and had good selection of shows and movies, though the remote seemed a bit unresponsive at times. Overall very satisfied.",6,28th June 2015,India
1715,"Flight was good and crew also excellent. Dubai airport a huge airport, but  there was no problem in finding the gate and the flight from DXB-KWI was amazing with lot of selection in the entertainment system. Food was excellent and the crew was also good. It was my first time in Emirates as well as the A380",1,27th June 2015,Kuwait
1716,"JFK-DXB on the A380. Hard product is great, excellent legroom, seats had decent recline and cabin was in good condition. IFE is top of the industry and is the best. Not only do they have a plethora of TV series but they have entire seasons. My biggest gripe about Emirates is the inconsistent service. Some of the flight attendants are wonderful but most of them on this flight were rude and unfriendly. Service was extremely slow and call bells were ignored. They had very terrible attitudes which is appalling. For example, during the breakfast service, a croissant was thrown at my tray because the flight attendant was simply too lazy to lean over a bit. Trays were also left in our tables for over two hours and when I tried to go to the galley and personally put it in the cart, I was met with a shrugged look. Catering was a disappointment and options easily ran out and were unimaginative, not what it used to be. DXB is also a mess and would try at all cost to avoid. Overall, still a decent flight but I would rather fly with another airline.",7,22nd June 2015,United States
1717,"MXP-JFK-MXP, both in Milan and New York I had to queue much time because I didn't use the web check-in system and aircraft was crowded. Ground service excellent and onboard service as well. During the outbound route crew offered snacks and dinner while on the inbound flight dinner and breakfast with snacks again. For every meal I had two option between a fish or meat and both were good. IFE is very nice with a big variety of films, music, documentaries, radios and so on. Seat were very comfortable although I flew in economy class on a 9 hours flight. Crew polite and available for requests by passenger. Outbound flight departed on time and arrived 20 minutes early in New York while inbound flight to Milan rejected take off so we had 40 minutes delay but we arrived in Milan just 10 minutes after the scheduled arrival time.",5,20th June 2015,Italy
1718,"Complimentary limo, Check in and LAX Emirates Lounge all excellent. Crew friendly and hard working. Menu has been changed on this route (LAX-DXB), EK listening to the demand of frequent customers. But menu can still be improved. I noticed the entree of Seafood duo was excellent but Seafood duo again reappeared as main, which is odd.  Wine selection is good. Overall menu score is 6/10.  ICE is superb. A380 is superb. Cleanliness and on-time performance excellent. A good flight where I managed to sleep for 8 hours.",8,20th June 2015,Saudi Arabia
1719,"This was my 6th flight on the A380 Toronto /Dubai/Toronto route. I had a 12 hour layover in Dubai from Addis Ababa so the airline put me up at their airport hotel providing transport and food vouchers. The hotel service was excellent. Emirates has a special area for layover passengers at DXB airport that have a layover of more than 8 hours. DXB to YYZ was full and crew were very busy. A380 has an excellent entertainment system which has many movies in CC .This is an extreme plus for me since I am deaf. The washrooms were cleaned. The food was excellent with ample choices. Lots of snacks with an open bar! The seat was comfortable even though a fellow passenger hogged up part of my seat territory. There was WIFI but I did not use it. Fellow passengers said that it was spotty. Crew fantastic, cheery and chatty with the passengers. They answered the call button when people used it. Smooth take off and extra smooth landing.

1720,"JFK to Dubai with Emirates.  Since it was a long flight, I expected a nice sleep but was distracted with a long tantrum from a little kid throughout the flight. The aircraft condition was good, clean. Good flight entertainment but I hope they update the selections. The food is so-so because the bakery were served cold (croissant and bun).  The cabin attendant were friendly at first but maybe due to a long flight, they get tired when we were about to land, plus with that little kid. Overall, my journey was not the memorable one. It was because of negative things but not with good impression.",9,19th June 2015,Malaysia
1721,"My first experience flying long haul (London-Sydney) with Emirates in conjunction with Qantas, and  it has been a really frustrating experience not least an unpleasant one. Right from my 24 hr delayed flight to the customer care or the aftermath of my family vacation to the way both Qantas / Emirates handled my complaint and the treatment has been appalling. Qantas passed this fault to Emirates (operator) and Emirates blamed the airport ground staff for the delay due to a technical fault! Qantas wesbite is not very clear as there is no email contact available to directly liase with whoever's handling my complaint or customer care department. Customer service email is no longer in use, according to the automated response to my online complaint. ",8,19th June 2015,United Kingdom
1722,"Generally, this was a very good trip. If I ever have an issue with Emirates, it is delayed or missed connections at Dubai airport, but on this trip all went to plan.

Only complaint is the older aircraft in use from Dubai-Nice, which has no wifi connectivity. ",8,18th June 2015,Singapore
1723,"EK863 and EK19 on 12 June and it was a seamless experience. I've been doing this route (or one to Birmingham) regularly for over 2 years now and appreciate the consistency of the service. The A332 Muscat-Dubai is rather old but who cares for a 45-minute hop, but service is still very good. I also had a free upgrade to First to go with one from Manchester to Dubai on the outward journey, so I guess that increases the feel good factor! The leg to Manchester on an A380 was perfect. The cabin crew were good , service was efficient.

1726,"I have traveled on Emirates airlines since it's inception in the 1980s when I was a resident of UAE. My husband and I were very excited to become a part of the Emirates airline family once again when the routes to Asia from US were introduced. I flew the SFO to India (Bengaluru) route for the second time in 18 months last month (May) with a stop over in Dubai for 2 days. I received an e-mail confirmation 24 hours prior to my travel time. However, when I arrived with my 7 year old daughter at the airport to check in 2 hours prior to travel time, I was informed that our seats had been given away. I had even requested and reserved specific seats for our family 2 months prior to the travel date over the phone with an Emirates customer service representative. We had to wait 30 minutes and were then given 2 seats to travel to Bengaluru and then were made to rush to the gates to make the flight. I was informed by the agent who was checking me in that my seats were given away because I had not checked in online! I told her that I had received e-mail confirmation just the day of travel, confirming my seats and now I was being told that online check in was necessary to ensure getting seats to travel. Our family travels all the time in several different airlines and have never heard of online check in being required to confirm having seats! We had to deal with this same stress once again upon our return journey from Bengaluru at the Emirates check in counter. This time I had confirmed all our tickets online prior to travel as suggested. However, when we were ready to check in our baggage, we were told that my husband's seat was not available and they could not seat us together. We had to wait for 20 minutes and insist on getting the seats that we had requested and wanting to speak to the supervisor before we were finally given the 3 seats together. Once again, they said that they had to hold our seats as the flight was over booked and full. I fail to understand how this can happen to any passenger traveling on an international flight who had confirmed tickets 2-3 months prior to travel date! We arrived on time as per schedule at the airports both the times to check in luggage and followed standard Universal airlines protocol. There was no apology for all the inconvenience and stress that was caused when we were finally handed our boarding passes. The agents at the counter made it appear as if they were doing us a favor by being able to give us boarding passes and seat us together. It was very disappointing to experience all this by traveling on supposedly a World Class Award winning airline.",6,16th June 2015,United States
1727,ZRH-DXB and return on A380 which is a pleasure to fly as it give a little feeling of space in economy. Good seat width and very quite aircraft. Good service and food though not as good as the best asian airlines. Great IFE. 4 flights on Emirates and everything went fine.

Because of busy flight the crew took a long time to clear trays but requests for extra drinks were met. Toilets kept clean. ",2,14th June 2015,United Arab Emirates
1731,"Very disappointed with Emirates as I've heard people praise them. Where do I start? Touch screens for TV/movies did not work properly, I was constantly having to press it. I had two sets of headphones and neither worked properly. Attendants seemed constantly harried with poor time management skills, although they seemed to find lots of time to have a group gossip in the galley at the back. On the Dubai-London leg the young man in the window seat near me as getting wet from an overhead drip originating in the air outlet. When he asked politely if he could move he was told curtly no he could not, even though there were spare seats. Just before we touched down in London there was announcement could the five gentlemen who should have been travelling to London Gatwick make themselves known to cabin crew. How can the Emirates staff let people booked on a London Gatwick flight get onto a London Heathrow flight? We had a good laugh about that one. ",6,14th June 2015,Australia
1732,"Flew EK372 from Dubai to Bangkok on the A380. The A380 is a magnificent aircraft! Overall, very impressed with their service this time. Complete opposite to the previous times I've flown with them. The crew were superb, chatty and greeted passengers with welcoming smiles. During the flight they were very attentive and when called there were no grumpy faces! In terms of entertainment, I don't think any airline can beat Emirates' ICE entertainment system. It's fantastic and you'd never get bored with their selection of movies offered on their enormous screens (bigger than your standard iPad!). Loved their on board cameras too. Seats and legroom on the A380 are great - by far better than their cramped 777s! The plane was also only half full so I had 2 spare seats next to me. The food was good although I wasn't very hungry and didn't finish it all but needless to say there was plenty, not to mention the extra snacks offered on board. Emirates also give you real cutlery not plastic ones. Only downside is that toilets got quite dirty and weren't taken care of by the crew (but this of course is also down to careless passengers) and WIFI didn't work properly though with all of the above, you forgot it was even there. I shall look forward to flying back with them next month. I highly recommend.",8,13th June 2015,United Kingdom
1733,"I have flown Emirates 3 times in the last six months but clearly customer loyalty means nothing to them. My mother, brother and I are scheduled to fly with them to Italy tomorrow for my brother's 21st birthday but we got a call from them today (less than 24 hours before our flight) to say that our flight has been cancelled and we have been moved to another flight. The problem with this is that we were scheduled to arrive in Rome at 07h25 in the morning after a short 3 hour layover in Dubai but now they were making us arrive at 20h20 in the evening after a 16 hour layover in Dubai! I have called Emirates countless times today and wasted my entire day trying to get an earlier flight and they say there is nothing they can do. We are only going for 5 days so to lose an entire day, have a 16 hour layover and lose out on all the tours we had planned is just unacceptable. Very disappointing. This is the last time I will be flying Emirates.",8,12th June 2015,South Africa
1734,DXB-LAX - June 4th 2015 - The positives: Flight departed and arrived on time complimentary chauffeur reliable pleasant and polite A380 is a great plane to fly in and off course the unbeatable ICE IFE system with large screen in Business very few airlines in the world can beat Emirates on this one. They also have changed their menu on this route a welcome initiative after goodness knows how many years the previous menu has been served on the route. The mediocre part of the trip: Service quality difference between the multinational cabin crew. Some goes the extra call of duty being very accommodating some gives you the impression that they wish to be elsewhere one stewardess was just unpleasant - I do not need to justify my second request for a burger as the serving was minuscule as a mid-flight meal. Mid-flight desert was excellent. Breakfast main sounds appetizing on menu - poached eggs turned up rather disappointing the termed boiled is more appropriate the accompanying Salmon Potato Rosti was soggy rather than crisp. Overall a disappointing plate that is just so far from its description in the menu. Lunch menu prior to arrival on the other hand is excellent. Seared Tuna loin on edamame is a welcome change to the rather boring Arabian meze. Shrimps served with polenta is a welcome option to the permanent features of the menu the plain old steak and Indian inspired dish. Dessert is excellent. Menu on this route still needs to be perfected and I know Emirates can do this judging from quality of meal/wine on board of other route (SYD-DXB).,3,7th June 2015,Saudi Arabia
1735,DXB - Istanbul - DXB Y class. Gold member with EK regular flights mainly Long haul in J class this was a business trip. Both flights full to the ceiling both flights late by one hour staff obviously over stretched but in no hurry and not one I ever saw smile. Entertainment would have been good as usual with EK except the ear phones I had and changed twice were useless due to the engine noise and two men talking behind me so could hear nothing. Staff service as mentioned massive difference from J class really is a case of get them in and get them out. No call bell answered ever actually looked at me and walked off - never again Y class EK. For 1000 USD$ for a supposed 4 hour flight - crazy.,10,6th June 2015,United Arab Emirates
1736,Flew LHR to MEL in business class. Trip I take 3-4 times per year on EK (both economy and business). Over a 12 month period Emirates scores very high on the overall product and their planes are new and very comfortable. i write this review because the last flight was plagued by uninterested cabin crew menu that never changes lack of non alcoholic beverages to match wine/champagne list (unlike Etihad and Qatar) food that was poorly reheated (business class) bread selection (again unchanged but truly awful in taste and texture) and lacked freshness and flavour.,7,6th June 2015,Australia
1737,MXP-JFK return in Business. Aircraft's B777 and A380 brand new seats so comfy as usual their multicultural staff is very professional and attentive to each passenger. Food and wine were also top notch. Their service is really far away the best on the market from Italy to US. Real value for money. Recommended.,10,4th June 2015,Italy
1738,Flight EK418 BKK to SYD. 2x3x2 configuration. Seat adequate with duvet addition making it more comfortable to sleep. Food and beverage selection limited and food quality just average. Staff very aloof and inattentive. Inflight entertainment was good.,1,1st June 2015,Australia
1739,26-27 May DUB-DXB. 27 May DXB-KUL. My best Emirates flight yet. First off their website is excellent I checked in online and paid for excess baggage at a discount this let me drop off my luggage without any hassle. The flight was smooth all the way every staff member I met with were very friendly. Though the seats weren't perfect I managed to catch a snooze on the flight! If there were any shortcomings I surely didn't notice it because the only impression I got was that I would be flying Emirates once again.,2,1st June 2015,Malaysia

Looking forward to fly with Emirates again!,8,1st June 2015,Netherlands
1741,Auckland to Sydney EK413 28 May 2015. Drink trolley came 15 minutes after the meal trolley. All passengers around me had therefore finished their meal before being provided with a drinks service. Dinner menu offered Beef or Chicken however the option was in fact Fish or Beef? The crew in the mid section of the cabin seemed very disorganised and lacked supervision. I activated the call button and it took 20 minutes to have any attention given and I was not the only passenger in this situation.,10,31st May 2015,Australia
1742,Flew to Perth stopping off in Dubai. Not overly impressed with Business Class Lounge in Heathrow a very limited breakfast. Boarded their new A380 and it was fabulous. I thought I was in First Class initially. Very comfortable and spacious seat and huge screen and many up to date films to watch. Very pleasant and efficient cabin crew who dispensed hot flannels (face cloths) regularly. The food was excellent and the bar at the back well words pass me. 18 year old Chivas Regal and top class nibbles (nuts and savoury biscuits). The entire flight was a singular joy and if you are using Emirates do try to upgrade if an A380 is the plane being used. Even the US pilot (he told us) seemed to have a purr of happiness to be flying this wonderful beast. So why the low assessments I hear you asking? Well it started going downhill after disembarking. Had to undergo another bag and body security check (not Emirates fault). Then the nightmare trying to find the gate for the second flight. I was given so much false information. Finally got to check in which was slow and ponderous and another bag and body security check. This time a Boeing 777. Oh! what a difference. It was old tired worn out and uncomfortable. The seat could lie flat but was very narrow preventing changing positions when sleeping. The television screen was significantly smaller too. The cabin crew were very friendly and pleasant and the food was good (just as well I like fish though). The difference between the A380 and the Boeing 777 was astounding. Come on Emirates do something about this.,9,31st May 2015,United Kingdom
1743,Flew EK725 from Dubai to Dar Es Salaam 19/5/15. I often fly this route after flying from New Zealand and always prefer this older 777 as it consistently has a great crew brilliant service and food/drink. Much more attentive than the huge long business class on the A380's where crew walk for miles to ferry food and drink. I only marked them down on the seat as it is an older one and same for the inflight entertainment otherwise I would rather fly these older planes than the 380's apart from the bar area of course.,10,31st May 2015,New Zealand
1744,I travelled from Perth to Dubai on 28/5/2015 and from Dubai to New York on 29/5/2015. I thought the food was excellent and the seats were comfortable. The flight attendants on both flights were nice and friendly. Even though both flights were very long they seemed to go quite quickly. I will fly Emirates again.,4,31st May 2015,Australia
1745,"Travelled NZ to England 3 flights both ways in May. I think their standards have slipped having flown with them several times now. My main gripe is the miserable cabin crew. Hardly anyone smiles or gives eye contact. The food was ok but quite repetitive. We often didn't get to choose the meal we wanted as ""they had ran out"". It's a pity you can't give an indication of which meal you would choose prior to the flight so they can get more accurate supplies. Meals seemed a bit disorganised and drawn out at times and we couldn't believe that they abandoned the last ""sweet snacks"" round after serving half the cabin. We thought the staff were going to get more supplies or we would be served later but no. We got nothing. Then it was time to land with a 3 hour wait for the next connection so we had to purchase some drinks and snacks in the airport to keep us going. Maybe they left it too late to start the snacks round. But again better organisation is therefore needed. The staff were not seen much in between the food and drinks serving unless somebody called for them. On previous flights they often came round with extra water. But this time hardly at all which left us quite dehydrated as I didn't realise till the end you could self serve from a point on the aircraft. This should have been made known to everyone at the beginning of the flight. We had the Airbus for all of the flights which was a great. The entertainment and leg room were much needed on such long journeys. All in all we are keen to try a different airline next time.",8,31st May 2015,New Zealand
1746,May 2015 EK418. BKK-SYD-CHC fantastic as usual. Emirates are my airline of choice and they have been for some years. My flight was on time staff were excellent and there was nothing to grumble about.,3,31st May 2015,New Zealand
1747,As an avid Qatar airways traveller I thought it is only fair that I write my thoughts on my recent flight from Manchester UK to Islamabad PK with a 3 day stop over in Dubai with Emirates travelling out on 26/04/15 and returning on 13/05/15. Confession this was the first time I have flown with Emirates and not had a major complaint. Travelled with my Mother and 3 year old Nephew. The flight going from here was fairly full but the staff were extremely pleasant and helpful. The Seating was ok food etc was served on time and they were efficient. They had better inflight entertainment compared to Qatar so my nephew was kept occupied. The food served was very nice. Flight from Dubai to Islamabad was very quiet not many people were traveling so they were able to quickly serve and people were able to sleep in more comfort if required. The return flight highlight for me would have to be the A380 from Dubai to Manchester they had more entertainment for the children as well as the adults. Seats were extremely comfortable cabin crew were really sweet especially with my nephew. I have travelled on A380 last year but my experience was not very good. Only complaint on behalf of the older generation would be the amount of confusion that there was once we had got to Dubai airport due to the sheer size a train had to be caught from one terminal to the other there were a lot of people were very confused about this and I cannot really blame them. However based on the overall experience I would definitely travel with them again.,6,29th May 2015,United Kingdom
1748,BKK-DXB-LHR and LHR-DXB-BKK. First leg BKK-DXB EK 373 was cancelled for 27 hours finally managed to get on the next days flight again the flight was delayed so we missed our connecting flight. The A380 is a jumbo jet however the Emirates seats are very hard. Your legs will get very sore after 2 hours flight in. Food is so so and the cabin crew are mostly unpleasant or just not willing to help. DXB to BKK sit on the first row right outside toilet a nightmare as you can't sleep at all with a long queue of people waiting for toilet the entire journey. Nevertheless I won't fly with Emirates again.,9,29th May 2015,Thailand
1749,CPH-DXB return. Very attentive staff from beginning to end FA's very friendly and well groomed. Having flown this sector previously with QR I can only say the service level differs in the fact that EK staff are less robotic and overly smiley at least on my flights. Would definitely fly with them again.,1,27th May 2015,Denmark
1750,Flight EK375 Business Class from Bangkok to Dubai on May 23 2015 on a A380. After viewing all those promotional videos from Emirates I decided to use that airline to fly to Riyadh via Bangkok and must confess that I am somewhat disappointed. The lounge in Bangkok is quite plain and sterile with a very limited choice of food. As to the flight itself seats are not ergonomic: the armrest is very short due to the separation panel between seat and corridor and the table is difficult to pull out if you are very slightly overweight. Emirates is quite stingy with amenities and even socks are taken away at the end of the flight if unused. Service was efficient but it cannot be compared with the one on Etihad where you can wine and dine anytime and where the choice of drinks and the quality of food is far superior to what is offered on Emirates. Flight attendants were relatively indifferent. The bar of course is very nice and that is the best thing on that flight. The cabin decoration is reminiscent of a hospital corridor. All in all a flight without surprise but next time I will go back to the friendly Thai people or to the excellent Etihad performance.,8,27th May 2015,Thailand
1751,23 May 2015 EK 095 and EK 095. Just arrived in Dubai flying the A380 Business class seats 14 E & 14 F from Bangkok. Read so so so reviews before taking the flight. Am very surprised as really nothing to complain about. Excellent service fantastic food great seating very comfortable. I am 193 cm and experienced no problem at all with the seating despite complaints in other reviews think they must be difficult people to satisfy - it's a plane not a hotel! Would I fly business with Emirates 380 again - absolutely. Next leg is in the 777 to Rome so will review that later.,1,27th May 2015,Australia
1752,BKK-HKG-BKK trip on EK384 and EK385 respectively on April 1st and April 4th. On the outbound leg boarding was at will. Arrived at boarding gate about an hour before the departure time and was told to go ahead and grab our seats inside the plane. The cabin crew appeared to have little or no training in their jobs. They wore dirty shabby uniform. No safety checks or seatbelt checks prior to take off as one would expect from any airline. Rushed safety announcement which was barely understandable. The meal they served resembled a frozen microwavable quick meal. I picked the chicken offering which smelt and tasted horrible. Cabin crew were mostly absent through the entire flight. On our return leg same story with the meal - I didn't even bother to touch it. IFE screen was frozen on my wife's seat and despite promises from a crew to reboot it nothing worked. Headphones for half the passengers in my section were broken as could be seen from passenger complaints onboard. I fly this route at least once a year and do not look forward to flying EK again unless desperate. The A380 is an amazingly comfortable plane to fly however EK service was a massive letdown.,6,27th May 2015,Canada
1753,AMS-DXB-HKG and MEL-DXB-AMS. Overall I was impressed by the aircraft (especially the amount of space in the A380) entertainment and catering. The crew however in my opinion delivered a very inconsistent service along the different flights. In general the welcome during boarding was excellent personal and warm. But then the crew members differed so much that I was puzzled. Some really were excellent did lot's of extras to make you feel a welcome guest. The other half however in my opinion was either rushed tired did not reply to call button at all. No apologies/no sign of human contact were made at all on the long MEL-DXB flight after forgetting two rows on meal service not replying to call button buttons forgetting to hand out drinks ordered. It really was an accumulation of mistakes that can happen but the handling of it made me unhappy. All in all I will fly them again for the comfortable product they offer but I have tempered my expectations for the overall face to face contact during the flights which in my opinion weigh heavily.,3,27th May 2015,Netherlands
1754,On the flight to Dubai we wanted to Fly Business Class but unfortunately all Business Class and First Class seats were booked - so we booked Economy Class on the A380. This was the best Economy Class experience we have had the seats are wide with a lot leg room. Service was great.,3,27th May 2015,Switzerland
1755,EK435 Brisbane to Dubai A380. It was a full flight and I did not get the seat I requested however that is not unique to Emirates and the aisle seat I had 87H was ok its drawback was being knocked as people navigated the aisle. The noise from the flushing of the nearby toilets was annoying but after 14 hours and 20 minutes it takes very little to mildly annoy you. I received 3 adequate meals receiving a menu would have been nice and would have avoided much confusion and a protracted meal service as the dishes or lack of was explained to questioning passengers. Being seated at the back of the plane meant no choice of meal as they had run short of one of the options. The cabin crew from 19 countries speaking 17 different languages were young and seemed to lack any cohesion or team work. The meal services were seemingly the most unorganised I have seen but everybody ate in the end. The bar service was poor but that might be expected of this carrier but was available if you were prepared to go looking for it. The staff were not overly helpful and frequently served refreshment throughout the flight the cabin staff were commonly found in the galley areas chatting and seemed to lack some direction and co- ordination. The seat was adequate with better leg room than some carriers a foot rest would have been useful. The inseat TV screens and entertainment system were excellent. The onward flight was equally full - EK161 A330 with a similar review. This time a menu was provided and the bar did arrive in time with the meals. We were airborne without being offered any refreshment for almost 2 hours until the meal service commenced and again this was more disorganised and ad hoc than any other airline I have ever experience but again all were fed and watered. Towards the end of the 7 hour 40 minute flight the toilets were dirty the bins overflowing and toilet paper expended. These seats were less comfortable with less leg room and smaller TV screen. Overall and an average long haul experience slightly better than I expected. I would use again if the price point was enticing.,10,25th May 2015,Australia
1756,Three of us travelled with Emirates leaving Heathrow on 30th April 2015 and returning on 16th May 2015. The trip to Singapore was ok but initially food of choice was not given to us until 30 minutes later they managed to find us the curry mutton. However the complaint I have about the flight is the return trip from Singapore stopover at Dubai to Heathrow. The first leg between Singapore and Dubai was fine. It is flight from Dubai to London on the 16th May 2015 which I am most unhappy about. At the start the flight was late. The air-conditioning was not working under the heat in Dubai. The pilot did inform us of the fault with the air-conditioning but that it would be fine once we were in the air. The flight was delayed 30 minutes and we were not given water from the flight attendants. For that reason I doubt if I will fly with Emirates again.,2,25th May 2015,United Kingdom
1757,LGW-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. LGW-DXB B777. I had forgotten how bad the Emirates 777 were the decision to have 4 across the middle makes the aircraft feel cramped and the one I used felt in need of a refit. The good selection of movies and TV can be let down with many faults only the left side audio worked in my seat after trying 3 different head sets I gave up and the seat next to me had to be rebooted several times before it would work. All other legs on A380 had the feeling of space and room and after the 777 was excellent but still several cabin issues either with the IFE or the seat not being able to recline fixed by a male member of the cabin crew putting all his weight on it and forcing it back. I sat it up for the meal and it would not go back again so the rest of the flight was spent upright. Meals came at odd times and the drinks came much later than the meals. As for the cabin staff they are a very mixed group so you are never sure of the level of service you will get I went on one flight to ask for a toothbrush and it was met with a look of what do you expect in economy class then the curtain was pulled shut and I was left wondering if there was one or not a minute or so later a hand comes out of the side of the curtain holding 2 toothbrushes.,10,22nd May 2015,United Kingdom
1758,Flight EK008 from London Heathrow to Dubai 16 April 2015 Business Class. The seat I was assigned 10D did not recline and was broken. The system was rebooted 3-4 times from the shoe holder from the rack alongside the seat from the control area of the aircraft and separately by another to physically try and push it down each one extending for up to 15 minutes and me forced out of the seat for the majority of this period and this went on for about 3.5 hours of the 7 hour flight. Until then I was not moved to any other seat with the rebooting I couldn't use the entertainment options for a couple of hours as well. After the Chief Purser heard about this she immediately took action and moved me to another seat. I was for approximately 2.5 hours of the flight moved to seat 4K on the flight thereafter. The electronic console handset which is connected to the seat did not power on and didn't work. There was water clogging in the shower in the bathroom on the right side of the aircraft. I had a vegetarian oriental meal requested and instead it was an Asian Vegetarian Meal that got loaded. Once again we are now in the 21st century and still Emirates Business Class does not have a single (out of four) main course meal options in the menu which are vegetarian. Often last minute travel options have to be ticketed and this means I will not have any assurance of a vegetarian meal option on Emirates. Seems odd and not befitting an airline such as Emirates which has fantastic infrastructure and options available to it as well as world renowned chefs. Overall as you can imagine this was disappointing for me as a Platinum member flying Emirates.,10,20th May 2015,India
1759,CDG-DXB-KIX NRT-DXB-CDG. A380 / B777-300ER. First time with Emirates with high expectations. In terms of aircraft's themselves not disappointed at all. Great seats (especially on the A380) with space enough to bear long flights and extremely wide selection of entertainment. What disappointed me was first of all the service. In all 4 legs almost all crew members were almost bothered to give service. No smiles at all. When you asked them something basic like a glass of water you almost felt you were bothering them. Another disappointment was food quality and quantity. Continental breakfast from DXB left me hungry for few hours. The rest of meals acceptable but not good as other European Airlines (AF or KLM for example). Overall really not in line with my expectations and not same overall level as other airlines as SQ or QF. Anyway prices keep being competitive so at the end fair value for money.,3,20th May 2015,France
1760,Flight EK207 Dubai-New York May 14th 2015. We boarded the plane with 400 people and no air conditioning on time with no delays. When we were moving towards the runway the plane stopped and after an hour the captain realized there was a technical issue. We were kept onside the plane for 2.5 hours with no food or water. The flight crew were most inconsiderate. It was a madhouse! People were frustrated and angry without any details on what was going on. They finally let us out from the plane into a tiny lounge (at least it had AC). Forget about food or water at this point. 1.5 hours later they boarded the same plane all over again and with total of 4 hours delay we finally took off. We were in Dubai home country to Emirates and the company couldn't expedite the problem with providing us with the new pane? It was my first and my last time with Emirates!,5,20th May 2015,United States
1761,Manchester (MAN) to Dubai A380 and then on to Christchurch (via BKK and SYD) on B777. Return from Auckland to Dubai (via BNE) and Dubai to Manchester all on A380. My first time with Emirates (lots of KLM/AF in last 5 years) and overall a good experience. A380 seats slightly wider so feel more roomy but what gave most space is that with exception of one leg (BNE to DXB) seat next to me was empty. Food mostly OK (one meal was cold) but Emirates choice of meal and times seems odd. (So 10pm flight out of MAN serves eve meal but no breakfast before landing at 7am local time) next flight leaves 9am local time and then serves lunch almost immediately. On the longer legs I miss the 'help yourself buffet' cart that KLM/AF have in the galley. Cabin crew vary a lot huge range of nationalities means considerable variety in service. In A380 it takes a while to get served so your meal is eaten (or left to go cold) long before you get offered a drink. Inflight entertainment is excellent once you've got used to having adverts at the start! Overall was happy with Emirates but didn't love it. I suspect the reason they were cheapest flights is because they do everything to a tight budget and the economy experience reflects this.,9,20th May 2015,United Kingdom
1762,I just used Emirates for the trans-Tasman trip from Auckland to Melbourne so benefited from being in a big plane. It was the first time in many years that I actually enjoyed the trans-Tasman flight. Comfortable seat tasty food (real cutlery!) and polite service. Lots of movies and TV programmes to choose from and you had the option of viewing one of three plane cameras which made it interesting. The only downside was having to return the headphones 20 minutes before landing and I hadn't finished watching the movie. A tip to take your own headphones. I would highly recommend Emirates for Aus/NZ flights.,10,18th May 2015,New Zealand
1763,Flew from Manchester (UK) to Dubai on EK20 and then from Dubai to Christchurch (NZ) on EK419 (this flight stops at Bangkok and Sydney on the way. Returned from Auckland via Brisbane to Dubai on EK 435 and then to Manchester on EK17. EK419 is on a B777 with the remained on A380's. Cabin crew are variable but mostly good I suspect the multinational nature of crews contributes to this variability. The connection time in Dubai for the outward leg was 90 mins but there was someone at the gate who met me and other transfer passengers with shorter connections and escorted us to transfer buses. On most legs the food was reasonable (except for the hot meal from Auckland which was nearly cold by the time I got it) though the decisions about when and what to serve seem bizarre. For example the flight leaving at 7:30am served lunch 2 hours into flight and on the return I got two evening meals served 3 hours apart. Unlike KLM/AF who I've flown with lots in last 5 years there is not a self service buffet mid flight on the long haul legs. Entertainment system is excellent though it's unusual to have adverts on aircraft. Seats were OK a bit wider on A380. Overall it feels rather formulaic: fine when it all works but with no margin for error.,5,18th May 2015,United Kingdom
1764,EK722 NBO-DXB business class Seat 9J. 777-200. NBO airport a total nightmare. Why EK even bothers inviting passengers to its lounge there when it is standing room only is beyond me. I couldn't get out of it fast enough. The terminal was painful particularly the gate area. Once on board not overly impressed with the seat. Crummy selection of newspapers. I was chatting with my seatmate but the privacy divider would not retract which made conversing awkward. We were in the air for well over an hour before I had anything to drink something that would never happen on QR SQ or CX. The lead FA for the business cabin came around asking people how their experience was so far and seemed to be aware of the horrors of NBO airport.,10,11th May 2015,United States
1765,I travelled from Heathrow to Dubai and then onto Singapore. On my return it was from Tokyo to Dubai and then onto Heathrow. As far as I am concerned it has been the best airline that I have travelled with. Seating and leg room was more than enough (I'm 6 foot). The food was adequate but how many breakfasts and lunches can you eat? Mine was a total of 8. One consideration which I was very pleased with is the fact that I am asthmatic and every time without exception I have ended up with a cold or infection. Not this time on all of the above flights. This must mean that Emirates change the air filters more often than others.,9,8th May 2015,United Kingdom
1766,I have not taken an international flight for many years but before then I travelled overseas all the time often with 2 small children (by myself). This trip I flew Sydney - Dubai - Dublin for Christmas 2014. Then returned Manchester - Dubai - Sydney in Jan 2015. I found on all flights that the cabin crew were fighting amongst themselves and were not interested in the passengers at all. I felt that it was an imposition to ask for anything. I went to the galley and asked for something to eat when most were sleeping and was told that food would be coming soon. It came 2 hours later. The cabin crew were sitting/drinking/eating and arguing. The meal thing surprised me as I had never been hungry on an international flight before. We were fed twice in 14 hours. Otherwise it was as you expect.,1,6th May 2015,Australia
1767,I flew PRG-PER and SYD-PRG both through DXB and was satisfied. The staff was friendly and helpful seats comfortable and spacious enough the planes (B777 on all legs except for SYD-DXB which was on the A380) were (or at least seemed) new and the vegetarian meal was surprisingly tasty. Both of the flights between Dubai and Australia were only half-full making it much easier to sleep. The only hiccup along the way was high traffic at the Dubai airport due to which we had to stay in the air for an additional 30 minutes. I also had to re-book my second flight (the charge for this is 99 euro) which I did over the phone in about ten minutes and without any problems. After flying with Emirates before I had high expectations going on this trip and it's safe to say that they've been met.,9,4th May 2015,Czech Republic
1768,I flew with my wife and 3 year old son from Auckland to Dubai via Brisbane and then a few days later onto London all on A380s. Our son was given a pack with a book and activities as well as a blanket and toy on all the legs. On the way to Brisbane it took an hour before any refreshments were offered. Interestingly going to Dubai they didn't provide him with a child's meal claiming we had to order it in advance (but surely they can see on the passenger manifest he is a child?) We asked our stewardess on the first leg if she could find one. She said she'd be back in a couple of minutes and we never saw her again. We asked someone else to see if they could organise one for going on to Dubai and same again. On the way to Dubai the lights were left on way too long. Yet when we went to London our son was given a child's meal straight away and the overall level of service was very good. The meals we got were very good although the breakfast frittata was a bit overdone. No complaints about the superb entertainment options though. So same airline for two flights but two quite different levels of service.,7,1st May 2015,New Zealand
1769,Flight from ICN-DXB-MAD. Everything was fine except its cabin crew. Some were rude and never smiled. Dubai Airport is awful. It is just a shopping center with zero possibility to see the airport apron.,10,1st May 2015,Romania
1770,I flew on 21st April 2015 from Bangkok to London I had my baby with me and was feeling very nervous about flying with her but the staff were so friendly and helpful. When my baby cried they helped me calm her down especially one staff member who saved my sanity he even made me an iced coffee with out me asking. The second flight was not as great as I felt the staff weren't as friendly and welcoming I had the assistance light on for over an hour and no one came and when I tried to wave someone down they would just ignore me. You could also hear a few of them moaning about being tired and hungry which I don't think is very professional. The main thing I would say that was bad was at the baggage claim when the buggy's were the last items to be put round the belt so there was a lot of tired babies and parents waiting for their buggies.,1,28th April 2015,United Kingdom
1771,Flight EK225. Dubai to San Francisco. Airbus 380. Pathetic and Rude Infight service. Basic reply there are 400 plus passengers and 8 crew members only. If crew are short staffed is it a passenger problem? Terrible service at baggage claim more than 2 hours. Reason short staff.,7,28th April 2015,United States
1772,On a recent flight EK435 (A380) from Brisbane to Dubai on the 18th of April 2015 the flight had a technical problem shortly after passengers were boarded at 20.30 hrs. Resolution took over 3.5 hours during which all passengers were kept on the airplane with no food or drinks. Water and some fruit juice was distributed reluctantly by the crew after being repeatedly asked it appeared they did not want to go through the bother of having to open and close the trolleys before the flight took off! The Captain made a few sporadic announcements in the 1st hour of waiting and then disappeared leaving announcements to the Purser. All in all the 14 hour flight took all of 17+ hours. The food was as usual substandard the drinks as a few have mentioned only appeared after the food was served! I dread the day they are going to launch the new revamped A380!,8,20th April 2015,Bahrain
1773,"Was on the Emirates flight Dubai to Delhi in February. Have done this route several times. They have this weird practice of serving meals before serving drinks which is the norm even on their other flights. It appears like they'd rather not have the passengers order any drinks which are advertised as included in the flight cost. Secondly meal choices advertised on their Menu cards are almost always not fully available - its always ""Oh sorry we've run out of this option so all we can serve is this"" Great - than why offer a choice in the first place. Seats are cramped with lower than average legroom.",7,19th April 2015,Kenya
1774,Flight from Manchester UK to Dubai and on to Singapore (Boeing 777). Flight not bad at all seats Ok staff very good. Slight delay getting to Dubai but staff were very efficient at helping us to the connecting flight. Good flight back to the UK from Dubai on the new superjumbo airbus Great seats attentive staff nice atmosphere and food Ok. Would certainly fly with them again.,6,19th April 2015,United Kingdom
1775,Food quality on board the B777 and the A380 was very poor. I travelled via Dubai to Tokyo and returned to Gatwick after a four night stop over in Dubai. On all my journeys I was either unable to have my choice of menu because they had run out or the meal quality was extremely poor. The cabin crew apologised but said that they could not do anything and that my complaint was quite common!,4,16th April 2015,United Kingdom
1776,EK 5048 Wellington to Sydney (code share with Qantas) 21 March 2015. EK 413 SYD - Dubai 21 March 2015. EK 841 Dubai - Doha 27 March 2015. Excellent experience on Emirates. Staff service satisfactory meals of good quality and endless amounts of onboard entertainment.,1,14th April 2015,New Zealand
1777,We recently flew Emirates to Dubai and then connected to Kuwait. The food and service was second to none. When we flew back from Kuwait our flight was delayed. We originally had 1hr and 30 mins between flights. By the time we landed in Dubai and reached the terminal it was 7.20 am local time. Our flight to Birmingham was due to close at 7.30 am! We ran like crazy to our gate A17. By the time we got there it was 7.35 am! We were then told our gate had been changed to A4. There was no way we were going to make it. The guy at the desk phoned through to gate A4 and told them he had 2 passengers and would personally bring them himself. He then picked up my wife's hand luggage and carried it to a buggy. We made it last ones on the plane but would never have without that member of staffs assistance.,6,14th April 2015,United Kingdom
1778,Flying to Dubai from Manchester on 15th March 2015 Boeing 777 flight EK022 seat 21e and 21d. We found the service very poor. The female flight attendant never smiled or offered any greeting. We were not offered any drinks but had to ring the call button twice to get a response. On the second occasion for some water again rang twice and from the first call to receiving the drink was just over 11 minutes. This was before and after lunch not at a busy time. At lunch we had to ask for coffee which the male attendant leaned over to pore I had to ask for milk and sugar. The coffee was lukewarm and the attendant was equally out of sorts with himself. We have never had this treatment on previous Emirate flights. I wondered if we were on a no frills flight or was it because we can only afford to fly economy. Our return on 30th March was just the opposite with friendly crew and excellent service.,1,14th April 2015,United Kingdom
1779,Seattle-Dubai-Delhi and return. My first time with Emirates. Flew economy. 777-300 on all the legs. Positives: decent meals plenty of choices in IFE baggage offloading was quick. Negatives: for some reason during SEA-DXB leg the formation of two lavatories each per section didn't seem to work very well. There always seemed to be a line up. All four times they seem to be always taking off a bit late from all the four points of departure. We were bussed to the terminal at DUB on arrival from DEL which took extra 30 minutes of our lay over. Cabin crew could use a bit more politeness. Too many announcements and most of them were barely audible and sounded like mumblings. Overall not bad but I was expecting a bit more.,8,12th April 2015,Canada
1780,Doha to Dubai EK848 and Dubai to Zurich EK087. Both flights were 25 March 2015. Emirates was a great airline but lately its service levels are declining. We took a trip from Doha to Zurich with connection in Doha. On first leg we asked for blankets but no attention was given until flight landed and on reminding air hostess were told that no blankets were available on flight. On second leg the food was quite poor and head phones were collected 30 minutes before landing. Certainly service levels have declined significantly compared to 2 years ago.,9,10th April 2015,Egypt
1781,I was flying from Melbourne to Warsaw my plane from Melbourne was late and I lost the connection from Dubai to Warsaw. I was pleasantly surprised how Emirates organised another connection to my destination. The staff were wonderful and the food very tasty. On my way home for half of my trip I was allocated to Business Class - no extra cost. I highly recommend Emirates.,8,10th April 2015,Australia
1782,LGW-DXB-BKK and return. 3 legs with 777-300er and 1 leg DXB-BKK with A380. Overall not impressed. Expected a lot more from the Emirates name. Both journeys no wifi available or telephone onboard as advertised. The screens seems to be a bit unresponsive. Staff lacking the extra mile with far too many announcements unrelated to flight safety really disturbing at night time. Flying just once with Emirates is probably enough.,2,8th April 2015,United Kingdom
1783,"Just returned from a 3 week break to Oz Manchester to Brisbane (via Dubai) Sydney to Manchester (via Dubai). Have to say I was thoroughly impressed. Yes the service wasn't fantastic from all the cabin crew. Yes the meals weren't fine dining yes improvements can be made but if my 4 legs of this trip is anything to go from I would definitely recommend Emirates A380 services to others. We sat all 4 legs in 59 ABC in order to have the most stable journey so didn't test the levels down the length of this massive aircraft however what we received was extremely good and am looking at booking again for this 22 hour journey with Emirates on the A380. If I were to be critical then improving the food offering would be good and using ""secret shoppers"" to test flight attendants would help I interacted with around 20 flight attendants during these 4 legs and 18 were great it's funny how 2 from 20 will stick out more in my mind. Emirates need to be careful with traffic flow as we had an hour circling prior to landing in Dubai due to congestion and then 3 hours later had an hour sat on stand waiting for a slot due to congestion. In essence I'd definitely recommend the Emirates A380 service safety and comfort are first rate and with a few improvements I'd say even economy is first class!",8,8th April 2015,United Kingdom
1784,"My wife and I flew return business class from Toronto to Bangkok via Dubai. The Toronto to Dubai leg on a newer A380 provided excellent cabin service and food with the exception of the hot breakfast which was well below par. Upon arrival in Dubai we found The business class lounges to be very comfortable providing a good selection of food beverages and reading materials. The Dubai A380 leg went smoothly except for that hot breakfast again which once again proved inedible. The return flight A380 from Bangkok to Dubai was on an older series A380 and was a lot less comfortable due to a built in footrest which prevented me from stretching out my legs. I found this to be very debilitating as I have a bad knee and I was very uncomfortable unless I put the seat into the flat bed position. The Dubai - Toronto return leg was once again on a newer A380 and provided more comfort than the older A380. I still had not learned from my earlier hot breakfast experiences and fell for it a third time. This was by far the worst of all the three breakfasts and I took it upon myself to complain about the poached eggs that had the consistency of hockey pucks. The cabin crew were very apologetic and acknowledged that it was an ongoing issue. Overall the Emirates business class experience was expensive mainly pleasant but could be significantly improved. The chauffeur service was excellent however everything else isn't where it needs to be yet in order for me to stop shopping around for alternatives. My comments and suggestions are listed below. Business class seats are narrow and uncomfortable especially seats F & G which are only separated by an armrest. I was travelling with my wife so we didn't need to use the privacy screen which rises vertically from the armrest. Unfortunately even when it is not in use it still protrudes vertically from the armrest by approximately 9"" preventing use of the armrest for it's intended purpose or even holding hands with your significant other if so inclined. In business class the lounge 4 washrooms galley and stairs to the lower level are all at the rear of the aircraft. This can make for a very busy area particularly with cabin crews comings and goings. It also makes for a very long walk to the washroom if you are seated near the front of the business class section. Kudos to the cabin crew as they delivered all food on trays without resorting to the use of trolleys which would obviously restrict passenger movement and clog up the aisles. Having said that requests for individual items can be met by comments such as ""I'll be back in a minute"". When I mentioned to a member of the flight crew that the flight tracker program wasn't working during the Toronto return leg it was just met by a shrug of shoulders and no explanation? My biggest beef regarding my first Emirates experience is that we never once saw the plane's purser (cabin manager) on any flight as they never appeared from behind the curtain that separates first and business classes.",6,6th April 2015,Canada
1785,"I am a frequent traveler with Emirates and am sad to say it is all going downhill. MNL-DBX-AMM and CAI-DBX-MNL on the way back. The B777-300 ER is a nice plane with departure at 12.20 am. With all the time spent in the airport and the lousy lounges at Manila airport (not airline's fault) one gets to the flight starving. Just to find out they have ""Light Bites Service"". All options below business class standards. Tiny portion leaves you starving for the rest of the flight until breakfast comes. No service in between. This service takes more than two hours to be completed when people want to go to sleep as soon as possible. Then the connection to Amman was far worse. A330 plane is really bad when the passenger in front of you fully reclines you end up with his head on your lap. When things couldn't get worse they did on the way back. Ground staff at Cairo are as bad as the airport itself. No priority boarding long faces a true mess. Fortunately I was served dinner as it was dinner time. B777-200 also a very bad aircraft. My ICE screen got stuck when the guy in front of me reclined fully. Crew did nothing. Then another red-eye to Manila more ""Light Bites"" service crew took three hours in offering the duvet for the hard seats (by then they already woke me up). These flights require super-fast bed service not three hours after. An really can't you afford a true meal? Really disappointed.",9,6th April 2015,Philippines
1786,EK 415 SYD-DXB - business class April 4th 2015. Check-in agent was friendly. Flight was on time. The crew overall worked very hard aside from several juniors who seemed to shadow more senior stewardess whom need to polish further their customer focus skill. Food is of high quality (Seared duck as appetizer and steak). I skipped breakfast which was the first meal as I had enough breakfast from the Sydney Emirates lounge which serves very high quality breakfast. Wine on offer inflight is of high quality. ICE entertainment system again the best there is in the industry. A380 that is deployed in this flight is an early generation of the type as it does not have the latest innovation such as electrically controlled window shutters better ICE controller and slightly smaller screen. Overall a very pleasant flight and will meet the expectations of the most discerning flyer. Note to Emirates whomever design the menu/wine list for EK flight to and out of LAX should take note on the menu served in this flight. I got the feeling that these menu are designed by 2 different staff/divisions.,7,6th April 2015,Saudi Arabia
1787,My husband and I flew from Johannesburg to Istanbul via Dubai in late March 2015. The flights to Dubai and then Istanbul were fairly uneventful. I had requested a gluten free meal. The gluten free portion of the meal was unimaginative and very unappetising. Arriving at Istanbul we waited at least 30 minutes for the luggage to be offloaded. The return trip however was an ordeal from beginning to end. The flight left Istanbul more than an hour late. We had to wait in a boarding area that was far too small for the number of passengers. We arrived in Dubai with 30 minutes to make our connecting flight and were told that we had been rescheduled on a later flight which meant a wait of 5 hours through the night. Our compensation was an inadequate meal voucher. Meanwhile our original connection left more than 30 minutes late in any case and we could still have made it. The new connection also left late by about 40 minutes. My special meal request was not transferred to the new flight. The flight was jam packed and the service was patchy. When the coffee eventually came around it was absolutely cold. I will not be flying Emirates again.,8,6th April 2015,South Africa
1788,BHX-DXB-BKK 1st April 2015 777 then A380 - EK 0384 and EK 0040. A Tale of Two Cities! The contrast between these two flights was vast so the data below is an average of both hence here is my review for each leg. Leg One Birmingham to Dubai. Plane full seats squashed leg room limited staff mainly rushed and miserable touch screen sensitivity useless. Leg Two Dubai to Birmingham. Plane full seats much larger in width and leg room wonderful attentive staff new screen with light touch sensitivity. No headphones provided to me. The price was £480 return with a return in July which was excellent and was much cheaper than from HRW with a better and shorter DXB layover of 2 hours. Would use again. Two gripes - advertisements at beginning of films and shows annoy me so an ability to just watch 20 seconds of a bit of each film in order to get the gist of it would be great I have no time to wade through numerous adverts just to eliminate 80% of the substandard films. Gripe Number Two yes its the Emirates Music! Great when you only fly them occasionally but hideous when it just goes on and on and on a four chord repeat monotony come on Emirates how about the sound of silence?,9,6th April 2015,United Kingdom
1789,We have flown with Emirates more than 20 times. In the last 4 months we flew Business Class 8 times and First Class once. We have experienced 2 great flights with them but 6 awful flights. Emirates call centre were disorganised and provided conflicting information when we called to try to make changes. The crew in general are by far the worst we have experienced on any airline (including budget airlines). On 4 of the recent flights my wife was pregnant. Emirates made very little attempt to make the flight any better for her. We have flown with Emirates various times over the last 7 years and have found the experience increasingly worse. The food in Business Class has been paired back so much that it is almost inedible. They have chosen to use extremely cheap bread and pastry products as filler. The food at Singapore Business Lounge was inedible I say this as a statement of fact not a complaint. I returned to the main terminal and purchased food and drink from there and brought it back into the lounge. The chauffeur service is also highly variable. At Singapore we were collected by an 8 year old souped up mini van (replete with flashing lights inside and worn out interior) instead of the limousine they promise. We fly a combination of Business and First Class when we use Emirates our reason for this is to try to avoid undue stress when travelling to or from a holiday destination. Unfortunately we have found that for 75% of the time we come home feeling frustrated. We are going to try BA and Virgin for our future trips - I would highly recommend avoiding ever using Emirates airlines.,1,6th April 2015,United Kingdom
1790,I flew Emirates from Vienna to Harare in March. The difference in quality of aircraft from VIE-DXB to DXB-HRE was staggering. The Africa-bound plane was old the seats were narrow and uncomfortable (comparatively) the in- flight entertainment system was archaic (without even the detailed route tracker that is the standard of other Emirates planes). Before opting for the Business class flight I had flown Emirates coach a number of times and on the newer planes it is far superior to business on the Harare route if value for money is something you care about. Incredibly disappointed. The massive gulf in quality between the Europe-originating route and the Africa-bound one was massive. Unforgivably so given the fact that we were still expected to pay a premium. Poor showing Emirates.,1,6th April 2015,Austria
1791,Emirates A380 is the only way to fly long distance today. We flew from Spain to Dubai and back on it and once you experience the bar at the back and being able to move around drink chat and socialize you will not want to fly any other way than the A380 Emirates Business Class. It sets a standard of luxury that no other aircraft or airline can compete with. They know the meaning of going that extra mile and the A380 is it!,4,4th April 2015,Spain
1792,DUB-DBX-PEK and return. Four Emirates Flights in the last 6 days. First sector from Dublin to Dubai was astonishingly poor for an airline as reputable as Emirates. Chaotic boarding late departure - 1hr 10 minute delay. Staff onboard were generally surly abrupt extremely rude and unhelpful. One particular stewardess on this flight demonstrably lacked the people and interpersonal skills required to carry out her responsibilities. The aircraft's ICE system was particularly ineffective and difficult to navigate. However the further three flights resonated as if it were a completely different airline. Staff were utterly professional courteous caring and engaging throughout. The PEK-DBX flight epitomised the standard for exemplary customer service in every way albeit helped by the fantastic A380-800 aircraft used on this sector. Despite the first let-down Emirates will be my airline of choice for any future longhaul international travel.,8,4th April 2015,Ireland
1793,SYD-CDG-LHR-SYD. With stops either way in Dubai. Hadn't flown Emirates since 2005 and very mixed reviews but I had to book a trip due to a family illness in England literally booked 4 days before flying and Emirates gave me a very good price. On all 4 sectors I flew A380s couldn't fault them the planes were clean staff were courteous ICE was excellent and meals not too bad and above all the toilets were kept very clean flew in the forward economy section on 3 sectors and it felt very cosy. Keep it up Emirates will certainly fly you back to Italy next year with my wife.,5,4th April 2015,Australia
1794,DUB-DXB-PEK and return. First time to fly Emirates. Three flights on the Boeing 777-300 one on the Airbus A380-800. 3/4 sectors typified the renowned Emirates service but DUB-DXB left a lot to be desired with surly uninterested and even some ignorant cabin crew. Some even refused to bring water to passengers. Disgraceful conduct. The IFE system was also difficult to navigate on this sector leading to a less than satisfactory flight. However all other sectors were extremely good particularly service aboard the A380 from PEK-DXB. Staff were exemplary chatty smiling engaging and above all courteous. Our group received complimentary champagne on two occasions during the flight. They went out of their way to make us feel at home. Space was very good the IFE fantastic and food was excellent. All in all a wonderful experience and definitely my airline of choice for future International travel.,10,4th April 2015,Ireland
1795,A colleague and I travelled Business Class to Singapore (via Dubai) from Heathrow on our way to Australia and New Zealand end January 2015. Our flight on Emirates proved to be a highlight of the holiday. The crew the food the ambience the comfort was all absolutely fantastic. We travelled other airlines on our tour but none came anywhere near the standards set by Emirates.,9,1st April 2015,United Kingdom
1796,We flew from Birmingham to Melbourne with stops in Dubai and KL - very satisfactory. Excellent lounges and good departure times so the trip was as painless as possible. Service varied from ok to excellent. Seat 9A and 9B were well positioned comfortable and with good appointments and spaces for storage. Emirates is clearly a top class airline with all the trimmings that a long time traveller expects (for the $$$!). Their entertainment system is a bit hard to navigate. Program selection fantastic.,5,30th March 2015,Australia
1797,Traveled on 24th March 2015 flight EK435 from Auckland to Paris stop over Brisbane then onto Dubai. I would of appreciated more move selection the same with the music. 25 mins before landing our headphones were collected. Why? Flight attendants were slow bringing drinks. Flight from Brisbane to Dubai (13 hrs) I recalled them coming around with water 4x. I had to get up to ask an attendant to fill my water bottle because they were too busy talking in the food prep area. Meal selection always ran out by the time it got to the back rows. On our final flight the first meal from Dubai to Paris was served 3hrs into the 7hr flight it was breakfast of what was left over and not everything on the menu. Lunch again was what was left over and too salty I requested cheese and crackers and got told she'd come back after she served the drinks but I got nothing. One of the toilets (Brisbane to Dubai flight) soap dispenser was broken and soap seeped out onto the floor making a huge wet slippery surface. There was never moisturizers or spray in it and there was always one toilet not operational. I paid for a flight that covered all its services why should I be made to feel like my needs are not important. I didn't request extra food or alcohol I just wanted my choices on the menu toilet paper soap spray refreshers and moisturizer in a clean toilet and to be able to listen to good music and get water without having to ask.,7,29th March 2015,New Zealand
1798,DMM-DXB-BKK on March 26 - In Economy Emirates has a solid offering few airlines can match. Crews are friendly courteous. I wonder why these crews are not deployed on the long haul route such as LAX even on Business Class of the same route need crews like this set to work on. For example there was a crying infant who tirelessly screamed pretty much the entire flight much to the annoyance of many passengers. One of the crew offered the mother to look after the screaming child although not taken by the offered customer her kindness and customer orientation is surely noticed by other passengers. Food on this route is enjoyable Asian style chicken. Got upgraded to Business on the first leg which is very nice of Emirates to recognize my status with them. Seat is a bit hard on the A380 however bearable on a short and medium haul flight. I can not imagine sitting in that seat for a long haul 16 hours flight to LAX.,4,29th March 2015,Saudi Arabia
1799,Flew EK406 - Dubai to Melbourne on A380. I fly on a regular basis with Emirates. However the quality of service is exponentially going downhill. The food on this flight was terrible. Staff service was pretty poor and they weren't really interested.,10,28th March 2015,United Kingdom
1800,I flew business class from New York to Dubai. I was so looking forward to it since I heard that it was in a class by itself. What a disappointment. The crew were well scrubbed in their uniforms and led me to my seat. It consisted of a small cube like area with a nice sized video screen. I soon found out that the space was very constricting. My wife was next to me and a partition between us was lowered but not all the way. There was a 4 inch portion that still protruded that did not allow for comfortable placement of my arm. The lie flat seats were not truly lie flat. By the way this was an A380 and the seats were more 175 degrees. The head area seemed a little bit elevated. There was a cushion-mattress that was given to place over the reclined seat that did make it more comfortable but the confined space of the pod like area was uncomfortable. I could not really move my arms very well around my head. I had flown Air New Zealand a few months ago and their business class on a 777 was far superior. When I arrived on New York on the return the flight was an hour late. Even though my baggage was checked thru to Jetblue when I went through customs and tried to recheck the baggage I was told it was too late for it to be transferred to the Jetblue flight. It was 55 minutes to the flight and they needed an hour at least. The Emirates rep said she could not help me. I thought that she could have provided a porter to take the luggage over to Jetblue with me but I had to do that on my own. My next trip to Dubai I am going to try Etihad business and I hope that the experience is better.,6,28th March 2015,United States
1801,Flew EK406 - Dubai to Melbourne on A380. I fly on a regular basis with Emirates. However the quality of service is exponentially going downhill. The food on this flight was terrible. Staff service was pretty poor and they weren't really interested.,8,28th March 2015,United Kingdom
1802,BRU-HKG via DXB return 1st class. Fab driver pick service in all legs from residence to airport to hotel and back and to residence. A big plus! Check in fast as it should be. Fast track and lounge a pity. EK uses SN lounge and it is outdated and crowed always. Whatever time of day. Used not only by Star alliance members but also other partners too which makes it too warm overcrowded and nowhere to seat. Boarding ok and then the usual fab experience of EK first class although on B777 suites are smaller and not the luxury of showers. No amenity kit either. Connecting in Dubai is a mess. Non one around and the first class in concourse C is small and not that good. Again boarding to HKG very average and not prioritized as it should be. A380 excellent experience not my first one with them but meals are very average. Excellent ICE. Return on HKG - Dubai leg not so good staff were rude and unpleasant. Again connecting in course C is a mess. Last leg ok. Bag not first out and unfortunately zip was broken and lock missing. To have the bag repaired took me forever and wasted a whole day waiting for a pick up service who after an 8 hour wait never turned up. Very disappointed. Customer service is not good either. However staff in EK office in BRU helpful and hopefully all will be sorted out soon. Not yet done though. I only fly them 1st class and am a gold member but I will think twice when choosing EK again.,7,27th March 2015,Belgium
1803,EK038 4 Mar 15 BHX to DXB. One and a half hours delayed. No drink service offered for another one and a half hours. Dinner then served without drink meal eaten before wine was served. On checking the menu I hate curry so informed the stewardess asking her to save me the alternative but she forgot so no main course for me. Very stressful flight due to worry about missing connection. Next year it's BA direct for us.,4,25th March 2015,United Kingdom
1804,Outward from Heathrow 24/3/15 EK002 to Dubai. Dubai to Mauritius EK701. Homeward Mauritius to Dubai EK704 on 11/3/15. Mauritius to Heathrow 12/3/15 EK001. Patchy service. If you did get a drink prior to take off it was immediately taken away. The seats were not clean. I actually found dry noodles on my seat on one leg of the journey. I had soup and scrambled egg served cold. You then have to sit and stare at your tray for 20 minutes or more after you have finished one course then wait again for the next. The staff are far too busy not enough of them no team work. Have flown Emirates Business Class before and was pleased but not on the huge A380. The only advantage was a fully flat bed but not too much of a bonus when the seats are not clean. Dubai Business Class lounge is like a transport cafe. Too big too few comfy seats too few ladies toilets. All in all not value for money. Awful.,10,25th March 2015,United Kingdom
1805,LHR-DXB - Seats spacious and ICE entertainment system excellent with a wide selection to choose from and a very large screen. However most disappointing was the crew onboard as they were very rude and made us passengers seem like an inconvenience. I was expecting a lot more from an airline like emirates in terms of customer service onboard. The food was also quite poor even for economy class.,3,25th March 2015,United Kingdom
1806,LHR to KUL via Dubai RT. Business class. Best business seat I've sat in on the A380 out of LHR. Service excellent - pity the meal I wanted wasn't available - and as I was not among the last to be served this was not a good sign of forward planning the catering supplies. The bar at the back upstairs is of course a great bonus!,7,19th March 2015,United Kingdom
1807,Airbus 380 LHR-DXB and return. Normally fly Qatar but Emirates were more convenient times so I gave them a go. Overall good but not as good as Qatar. Not impressed with the 380 Business cabin they've tried to squeeze in too many seats. OK I'm big but I've never had to ask for a seat extender before in business. Couldn't get the tray fully extended difficult to sleep as too cramped. Cabin staff excellent but due to size of cabin (over 20 rows) we got our wine after we had finished our food. Food fine. So much better than BA but some way to go to match Qatar. Airbus 340 DXB-COK and return. Older than 380 but more room so more comfortable.,2,18th March 2015,United Kingdom
1808,14/03/15 - Dubai to Newcastle upon Tyne. Business Class lounge very busy with unsmiling staff. Experience completely different once on board. Very helpful friendly professional cabin crew. Nothing too much trouble. Great level of comfort and ICE entertainment superb. Well done Emirates!,2,18th March 2015,United Kingdom
1809,I regularly fly Emirates from LGW-DXB-MNL and return. I have never had an issue until my last flight from Manila to the UK. Arriving at Manila for check in found that the flight was overbooked and Emirates were asking for volunteers to give up their seat. As a Silver member I was advised that I would be upgraded to business class for the MNL-DXB leg of the journey and all seemed well. The service on this leg was great meals were excellent and the business class cabin was roomy and comfortable. The only downside with this flight the entertainment system which wasn't working in Business class for most of the flight. The second leg from DXB to LGW was in economy class and this version of the 777 was very cramped much more cramped than previous Emirates 777 flights. Service was good though when trolley service was completed they struck the arm rest with the trolley breaking the headset plug leaving the prongs embedded in the socket. This resulted in the rest of the flight with no sound for entertainment system. Arriving in London found that there were issues with my baggage.,10,18th March 2015,United Kingdom
1810,From DFW 12/26/2014. From MAA 1/19/2015. I have been flying out from Dallas/Houston to couple of cities in India. Over the years Emirates have squeezed economy (or cattle class) as much as possible. Sometimes the behavior of the crew is surprising. Food is good however the overall service is okay only. Given that Qatar and Etihad now flies out of Dallas I will avoid Emirates in future.,9,17th March 2015,United States
1811,EK010 LGW-DXB was on an A380. The plane seemed very new with nice entertainment system and it was updated with the latest IFE system with a 10 inch HD screen. Seats were comfortable with lots of space to straighten your legs cabin crew were nice and friendly and food was delicious. The next flight from DXB-BOM was on an outdated B777-300 seats were quite old including the IFE system but the content was almost the same cabin crew were not friendly they seemed to be in rush all the time food was ok. On return my flight from BOM-DXB was on a B777-300ER and that was another plane with much more better seats and IFE system compared to the one I had from DXB-BOM although the service was nice and cabin crew were better with no rushing. On the A380 from DXB-LHR the plane was the same but the seats and screen of the IFE system were the same as the B777-3ER although the whole flight was nice was a bit disappointed with the system as the one I got from LGW-DXB was new. Will fly again with them.,8,17th March 2015,United Kingdom
1812,Boarded EK040 20/2/15. From Birmingham on time taxied to runway then had to return for an hour delay due to immigration once taken off cabin service was good the ICE entertainment system was not as good as it should be once nearing Dubai we were told we were in a holding pattern due to sand storm all connecting flights would be held once landed after an hour circling rapidly made our way to departure gate as notice boards stated final call. Got to the gate and plane had already gone. We made our way to transfer desk where nobody would offer an explanation as to why we couldn't land but connecting flight could take off we were given a new flight EK 372 a delay of 6 hours boarded on time but then told we couldn't take off due to sandstorm sat on plane for 3 hours before moving yet planes all around us were taking off finally landed in Bangkok 11 hours late the only thing that helped me from going mad were the excellent cabin staff. Must also make a mention of excellent Chauffeur service. Emirates wants to be worlds best airline not even best in Middle East. Will go back to Qatar for next flight.,10,17th March 2015,United Kingdom
1813,Dubai to Sydney Economy Class. After reading other postings here for Emirates just had to add my comments. I have travelled Emirates for many years but I feel customer service from the crew is getting worse. Friendly FAs are rare these days. The others just do the minimum of what needs doing without a smile. Almost knock you over if you are in their way. A couple of people took our seats and wouldn't move but the FAs couldn't care less. The once fabulous selection on ICE is deteriorating too. Plenty to see but a poor selection in English unless you like violent movies. Whatever happened to the snack pack with a drink at the beginning of a flight? Not served on my flight. Some passengers rang for the FA but they didn't come. Yes some might ring for minor things but on the other hand it could be an emergency. Annoying things on a long 14 hour trip these small things make a difference to the passengers. Lift your game Emirates or more people will be looking elsewhere. I firmly believe any airline is only as good as its crew. I am due another flight next week to Europe. Hope this is a better experience.,10,17th March 2015,Australia
1814,Flew Kuwait - DXB and DXB - Doha. Food drink and inflight entertainment is only what we can dream about on a short hop in Europe. However the crew were absolutely miserable. All of them. The crew also made no effort to enforce safety. During taxi there were people wandering around the cabin without being challenged at all.,9,17th March 2015,United Kingdom
1815,QF8423 27/2/15. Perth-Dubai - business cabin. (Qantas partner). Beautiful lounge with excellent friendly service. Plane clean and smart with seats/flat beds very comfortable. Nicely appointed well decorated cabin crew helpful attentive and smiley. Food although not exceptional was more than acceptable and service was first class. No complaints whatsoever about the flight. The problems began at Dubai. Very busy so held before landing. Dumped at least a 20 min bus trip from terminal. No information of where connecting (Qantas) flight was departing from. No one in terminal to ask. Inserted boarding pass into state of art machine that was supposed to tell us where to go - it didn't. 15/20 min fast walk to train to change terminals. Rush to gate and just made it as gate was closing. 4 people at least didn't make it and had bags off-loaded. This was simply not good enough. Took the edge off the whole Emirates experience - such a shame. Would imagine this problem will go once airport finished! Would fly Emirates again but would in the meantime ensure at least 3 hour transfer time. Qantas booked this connection not us.,2,17th March 2015,United Kingdom
1816,MAN-SYD and return. Couple of slight delays on take up but the airline made up the time and managed to land close enough to schedule. A380 all the way which is excellent because the business class cabin allows every seat to have direct aisle access so no stepping over your neighbour. Excellent storage and your own little mini bar in each seat. Bar at the back of the plane is great for taking a break on the 14 hour leg from Dubai to Sydney. Food good and IFE the best.,8,17th March 2015,United Kingdom
1817,"EK 10 on Jan 4th onto EK 770. Noticed that 25% of passengers received a drink before take off. Crew too busy to serve all of us. No drink service for the 2hr 27min. Each request met with ""it will be along shortly"". I realize that is why so many regular business travelers dashed to the bar before the seat belt signs were switched off. The meal was still cold when I mentioned this I was told that ""it had been dealt with in accordance with instructions and we are very busy"". It is very obvious that Emirates do not carry enough crew on the A380 to serve everyone the same in the business section. Make sure that you are not at the back! The next leg of the journey on a smaller plane was far better. They just did not bring the luggage.",1,9th March 2015,United Kingdom
1818,Flew from KUL-DXB-LHR and return. All flights were excellent. Flight was almost full on A380 to and from London but rather empty on A380 to KUL. Flights depart and arrive on time great IFE good food and attentive staff.,5,9th March 2015,Malaysia
1819,I travelled from London to Dubai EK006 by A380 aircraft on 30th July 2014 and Dubai to Dhaka EK584 by Boeing 777-300ER on 31st July 2014. EK006 was excellent the food was great the entertainment system and the service was fantastic! EK584 I sat on 40A in the back cabin of the aircraft there were empty seats but only the window seats are full. This means that I had the whole row to myself to rest my legs and sleep properly while lying down! EK584 was the best flight of my Emirates trip!,5,9th March 2015,United Kingdom
1820,EK 385 I have flown BKK to Jeddah twice in the last month and on both occasions misted my connection in Dubai. There should be a 2 hour connection time plenty of time for the connection. On both occasions the Captain said that due to a heavy load of aircraft at this time in the morning we would have to hold. Will give Qatar a go next month as Emirates can not get their act together.,1,4th March 2015,Thailand
1821,Flew as a package Heathrow to Dubai Dubai to Colombo Colombo to Male Male to Dubai Dubai to Heathrow. On all of our paperwork we had numbered seats together. We actually sat in these seats on the first flight and never sat together again. After 3 days in Dubai we arrived at the airport after midnight to find that there were no seats on the plane so ours had been sold to someone else. We waited to see if there would be seats as we had a connection waiting for us in Colombo. Desk was hopelessly undermanned and after a long wait no seats available anywhere on the plane. After 20 minutes or so it was clear there wasn't a hotel to go to either so spent an uncomfortable night in a cold Dubai airport with a voucher for probably the cheapest meal in the cafe. Got on the next plane in the morning which was delayed by an hour. We did get a voucher to travel from Dubai to Colombo! How this airline has built a reputation for being one of top carriers is beyond us. The only thing that was better than the cheapest airlines was the entertainment system but no way can this make up for the rest of our experience. We did write to express how we thought that our experience should be giving real cause for concern to customer relations. Never got a reply.,8,4th March 2015,United Kingdom
1822,My advice would be to avoid Emirates until Dubai Airport improvements have finished: too many planes have to park out on the apron meaning 30 minutes extra until into the terminal delayed baggage and rushed connections. Customer Service standards also seem to be slipping. On arrival at the airport I was informed my flight was delayed 3 hours but wasn't told that an earlier flight was also delayed and I could have caught that one and still made an onward connection. The previous couple of flights also had delayed arrivals (up to 2 hours) and therefore incredibly rushed connections (with onward flight delayed to wait for connecting passengers). Hope they return to previous high standards soon.,1,4th March 2015,Malaysia
1823,Flew SIN-BNE in J class on the 77W. This is my second and last flight with EK in business class and I had hoping for a better experience with them the second time around. This did not happen. The crew looked bored and as though they did not want to be there. They missed our welcome drink and I had to ask for ours as they collected everyone else's empty glasses. Then during the service the crew kept forgetting which rows they had served. A drink and nuts after take off were offered and then it was almost two hours before we were offered our first course. The fun started trying to get a glass of wine. They do not serve wine automatically with the meal like other airlines and instead walk around with a type of wine rack with a few glasses on it. Good luck getting their attention to get a glass. They walked past us three times while we sat looking at them expecting a glass of wine with our entree. I was served red but my partner was ignored. I rang my call bell and they arrived to see what could be wrong with me. A few minutes later the same FA walked past offering bread and no wine. At this point I lost my temper and could not believe what was happening. My partner had finished the entree and not had a drink for over two hours ago by now. Eventually the white wine came and the rest of the service was ordinary. They had no idea which wines they were serving or where they came from. It was just red or white and you pointed at which one you wanted. The food was very average quite boring. To me this airline just lacks soul. The IFE was good and the ground staff at SIN airport and the lounge were delightful. Just such a disappointing onboard experience.,2,24th February 2015,Australia
1824,Flew Chennai - Dubai and back. Both flights took off and landed on time clean interiors and great in-flight crew. A wide selection of movies and other programs on the in-flight entertainment system. The quality of food served was also good and no one was refused an extra drink. Overall a very good experience.,5,24th February 2015,India
1825,"My wife and myself flew from Glasgow to Sydney return January and February 2015 on economy. The worst flying experience. Five Emirates flights and all of them delayed! On two of the flights home they failed to serve two meals they even had the gall to state ""due to inclement weather economy meals will not be served"" OK if you were business or first but economy forget it! On the last flight back from Bangkok to Dubai the flight was late arriving we were met by Emirates staff who said our flight was being held for seven of us. We were rushed through Dubai airport (very large airport and some of us had ailments) no transport arranged. When we reached the departure gate the staff there told us ""its too late for you to get on we did tell arrivals this!"" We were then directed from desk to desk to make arrangements for another flight five desks in all we were sent too in all corners of Dubai airport. We managed to book flights later in the day and they offered us their hotel to shower etc. This meant another group around Dubai airport to get back through customs and to find the bus. We asked if we could just use the airport lounge due to the people suffering from all the walking and we were told ""you cannot use the lounge that is for business and first class only"". By the time we reached the hotel we just had time to shower eat a late breakfast and back to the airport to go through customs and immigration again. Emirates could not have made us feel any worse with there attitude and behaviour. Our advise to you if you are travelling economy is to go for another airline we have traveled on China Eastern and found the service much better than Emirates provide.",8,24th February 2015,United Kingdom
1826,Flight EK148 AMS-DXB on 7/2/2015 in business class. Boarding in AMS was a joke. The economy class pax blocked the way to the gate exit to the aircraft. The ground staff did nothing here when boarding for the first and business class passengers began. Chaos was the word that came to my mind. About 20 minutes delay on departure. Food was of poor quality. The inflight service no better than any other 4-star airline. The seats are acceptable and provide ample space. We were transported by bus to the terminal upon arrival in Dubai. This took about 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes walk to the to the train for transport to the next terminal and another 15 minutes to get to the lounge. What happened to their so-called famous A380 terminal where all A380 aircraft can be handeld. Lounge was OK. Flight EK384 DXB-BKK on 8/2/2015 in business class. No exciting flight. What you can expected for the price you paid for business class. Food was mediocre. FA were friendly and gave good service. Flight EK385 BKK-DXB on 19/2/2015. Again an uneventful flight with food less than mediocre. FA's acceptable. Flight EK147 DXB-AMS. The best of the four legs. FA omnipresent and very friendly. Food was good. The waiting times when changing flights in Dubai made traveling quite tiring. I think it will remain at this one experience with Emirates when travelling to South East Asia.,8,24th February 2015,Netherlands
1827,Flying Perth to Manchester for a funeral both out and return flights delayed therefore missed connecting flights on each trip (facing an extra 10 hours on the return leg). On arrival at Dubai no one met the passengers to offer directions to desks etc and on asking to use the lounge to send an email was met with a 'no' - not every one has a fancy phone with internet service! Hotel voucher led to a hotel room for a 'sleep' of approx 3hrs not worth the effort. For the cost of the ticket was not impressed with the lack of ground service or apologies for such a long delay one would think they would be more organised as this must happen regularly.,9,24th February 2015,Australia
1828,Flew EK 408: KUL to MEL on B777. Service was excellent! Welcomed with hot towel. Food was great. Staff was efficient. Flight entertainment was absolutely excellent. IFE screen was wide and large. The ICE widescreen was just great. Passengers was given access to front and bottom camera allowing those who sit on aisle sit to see what happens outside the plane. Powerpoint and USB port was available and I could charge my mobile phone! Plenty of films/TV show in multiple languages. Cabin was clean and the mood based lightning was synched to the skylight outside the plane. Staff were efficient and helpful.,6,24th February 2015,Australia
1829,A380 London Heathrow to Dubai 777-300 Dubai to Dhaka. A380 leg was comfortable food OK crew efficient. 777-300 Dubai to Dhaka - plane full cabin crew unenthusiastic - had to wait over 90 mins for food and a drink a drink should at least be served earlier if the wait for service is so long. Return leg Dhaka to Dubai 777-300ER plane again full. Cabin crew better and more organised but food was extremely disappointing-so called breakfast was a sloppy curry alternative was fish. Seats on 777 are cramped and narrow. Dubai to London Heathrow A380-nice new plane seats more comfortable and cabin crew pleasant organised and efficient. Cabin crews seem very variable too many need to learn to smile.,2,24th February 2015,United Kingdom

1831,My husband and have just returned from our holiday to Sri-Lanka and Dubai. We used Emirates on all four flights. We were very happy with Emirates except for our return flight home from Dubai. The service was not what we had previously experienced with the airline. We were some while into our flight when our first meal arrived clearly there was some delay with this meal as our next meal arrived within approximately an hour. It all seemed a little chaotic. We appreciate that the cabin crew worked hard and were very busy throughout the flight however during the other three flights in a two week period the service was excellent. We have flown with Emirates before and have received very good service so we're disappointed.,1,18th February 2015,United Kingdom
1832,Flew Manchester-Dubai-Singapore and returned three weeks later. Going out OK but remember much longer journey than with other airlines you also have to change planes. Service in past has made this acceptable not any more will I be doing it. Earphones were not working so entertainment not good going out on one half of outward journey. Return journey was a nightmare. Plane full and a seat in front that came so far back I had trouble opening my tray. The guy in front watched movies all the way but was not concerned that I had no room. Monitor did not work for three hours so they reset it three times before it worked. Seatbelt was falling apart. Toilet had no water in sink after putting soap on hands. Water dispenser also was not working. Second meal before landing not served. I was already unhappy from first leg. Second flight was from the other side of the airport a good thirty minutes dash never had such a distance on such a tiring journey. Dubai to Manchester now another eight hours if you are lucky. Problems with a forty ton machine being loaded in cargo hold falls off pallets and jams luggage hold. We sit in our seats for two hours waiting to take off. We eventually do set off. Leave aircraft and immediately complain on website. No answer as yet. I have travelled with Emirates over the years many times I will not be doing so again service is no longer there.,6,18th February 2015,United Kingdom
1833,Flew from Birmingham UK to Dubai on 27th January and did not enjoy the experience. Cabin crew were terrible. Half the plane received a hot towel before takeoff and then the crew could not be bothered with the rest of us and abandoned it. Dinner service was dreadful. The rows behind us received their food about an hour before we did but then they had to sit with their food trays for about another 2 hours before being cleared away. It was 3 hours in before we received our first drink. Finally the menu said we would get a hot drink and sweet treat before landing - nothing given. The crew were so slow it was unbelievable. Flew back from Singapore yesterday via Dubai and could not believe this was the same airline. Yes we all got given hot towels and again before landing. Very prompt with food and drinks and was a pleasure to fly with them this time.,5,18th February 2015,United Kingdom
1834,"Business class on EK 418 BKK-SYD. The flight itself on a 777 was good and my wife and I managed to get a decent rest on the angled seats. Had a very enthusiastic crew serving us with a smile. Dinner was well presented. We missed breakfast as we were asleep. Departure and arrival on time. Aircraft equipped with older ICE but not a problem on this medium haul night flight. Main negatives at check-in and upon arrival. I was very surprised that our reserved seats (9 K and J) were no longer assigned to us even though booked more than 6 months in advance. I am platinum with QF (code share on this flight) so got a bit upset as the check-in staff at the first class check- in in BKK tried to put us in to the middle row of three with one aisle and one middle seat. After rejecting this seat change lady suddenly ""found"" seats 10 K and J for us. Could not work out why our initially reserved seats were no longer available (managed to look at the boarding passes of both passengers sitting in 9 K & J and they had no status with EK or QF). Second negative aspect of the trip during luggage collection at SYD. Even though our 2 suitcases were both properly labeled with ""First"" labels and we checked-in at BKK 2.5 hours prior to departure our suitcases appeared as one of the last items on the belt in Sydney. As I said to my wife first economy passengers of our flight were already checking in to their hotels in Sydney while we were still waiting for our baggage. An overall great flight but check-in at BKK and luggage return in SYD needs to be improved. Also not impressed with the EK Lounge in BKK. Looks new and cozy with good food and drink on offer but the chairs are very uncomfortable.",6,18th February 2015,Australia
1835,QF 8043 from Dubai to Frankfurt on 5 Feb 2015. Have just flown Dubai - Frankfurt economy. Staff were less than enthusiastic food very unappetising plane rattled in an un-nerving way. Hoping the return flights to Sydney will be better!,10,18th February 2015,Australia
1836,HAM-DXB-NBO and return. HAM-DXB on the B777 very modern aircraft good seats. DXB-NBO on the A330 return B777 slightly older but good compared to several other airlines. Seats are good on all aircraft's plenty of legroom. Inflight entertainment probably one of the best in the world there is a big variety of Music Movies tv series games etc on a big touchscreen. Food is good (both quality and quantity) and I really like Dubai airport even though it is rather large. All flights on time. Really nothing to complain about great value for money!,1,18th February 2015,Sweden
1837,I flew SIN-DXB-BHX after spending New Year in Singapore. I cannot believe that the standards have gone down so badly. I have been flying EK since 2006. Transit in Dubai - Dubai airport can be a huge one and boast of passenger numbers but the reality is that it is finding hard to cater to the growth. Terminal 3 is supposed to be exclusive for EK but why no aerobridges provided. My flight departed SIN at 01.20 landed at around 05.00 in DXB. EK parked their B777-300ER somewhere at the far end of the airport and we were made to climb down the staircase at that time. We were packed in a bus and sent to the terminal which took some 15 to 20 min. I entered the terminal at around 5.45am and walked down for security check. Finally at around 6.30am I reached my gate B30. After the boarding pass check guess what we are asked to board a bus again for a 15 min ride to the far end of the airport where they have parked their B777-300ER again. There was no proper organised zonal boarding as everyone just boarded the flight through the rear door and had to queue a lot before taking the seats inside the flight. Inflight Service - The inflight service was awful. The standards have down in this area since 2010. Their food portions have gone down I always felt hungry after the meal! Cabin crew don't want to move from their seats at all! If you want something it is always better to go to the galley rather than wait for anyone.,8,11th February 2015,United Kingdom
1838,LHR-DXB-BKK-DXB-LHR. Four flights in a A380s in a week. Service was slick and professional but there were signs of cost-cutting. Some of the meals were excellent and other mediocre. Boarding the flights was a relatively anarchic process. There were two specific problems that were drawn to my attention by the cabin crew. The first is that many of the business passengers had apparently been upgraded from economy because Emirates had overbooked the flight. This meant that the cabin crew upstairs were working extremely hard and were perhaps not quite as happy as they normally are. The second was the build quality of the A380. For instance two of the four bathroom doors at the rear of business were faulty on a relatively new aircraft (A6-EEN) and according to the cabin crew there were quite a few other similar issues. This is of course not necessarily the fault of Emirates but quite a lot of passengers seem irritated when the light failed to come on it one of the bathrooms and the door failed to shut in another. It never ceases to amaze me that having been building bathrooms in aircraft for many decades manufacturers still haven't managed to work out how to design cup dispensers that allow you to take one cup at a time or tissue dispensers the release a single tissue rather than a handful. That said the cabin crew were assiduous on all of the flights in keeping the bathrooms clean. The flatbed seat was extremely comfortable especially with a mattress although sitting towards the rear of the aircraft meant that there was a constant matter of closing doors from the galley. The OnAir Internet works fine for the LHR-DXB leg and enables you to download your emails (assuming no large attachments) for free because it starts charging at 10MB and even then is not overpriced. However on the return leg it did not appear to work at all. GSM also worked at the cabin crew reminded passengers to keep their phones on silent to avoid disturbing people.,10,11th February 2015,United Kingdom
1839,I flew from Muscat to Geneva via Dubai with my 3 children. We were overall very disappointed with the quality of the service and the staff attitude onboard. Air hostesses were rude staff made us wait for our hot meals as we refused a menu we had not requested on the way back special meals were not edible! T3 in Dubai is unpleasant and not set up to host so many people and planes (30 min bus journey from the plane to the terminal).,2,11th February 2015,Oman
1840,EK412 and return on EK413 Sydney - Auckland return. A380 in business. As usual lounges both ends were luxurious spacious and comfortable. There is no doubt that the window seats on the upper deck are absolutely fantastic. Big screen TV private and comfortable. Outbound to Auckland the service was very slow and I only ate breakfast 20 minutes before descent. On the return flight no such problems. The bar is a nice touch and usable unlike similar products on 777's. The quietness of the 380 is unbelievable especially for travellers like me that cut there teeth on DC8's and 707's.,1,11th February 2015,Australia
1841,"BKK-SYD on a 777-300ER. Emirates will always score points when I travel on their A380s and 77Ws. The IFE is brilliant and the food and beverage service is excellent for an economy class product. This flight was let down a little by the crew. They clearly did not get on well with one another and for some this carried over to their dealings with passengers. The PA announcements also seemed overdone with little thought to the timing of some especially when being delivered in three languages. I found the boarding process interesting. Row numbers were called in increments of 5 logically starting from the back. There appeared to be an insistence that the entire gate area was scoured for every last passenger within the designated rows before the next 5 rows were called. I have never seen a 777 boarded so slowly resulting in a 20 minute delay. It looked like the ""rules"" were getting in the way of reasonableness and that overly technical atmosphere summed up the flight. This flight was QF- ticketed and my outbound journey was with QF. I rated them the same overall but for different reasons. Emirates has the hard product in its grasp but I preferred the QF flight for its reassuring professionalism.",3,11th February 2015,Australia
1842,BKK-SYD on a Qantas codeshare flying Emirates 22/1/2015 arriving SYD 23/1/2015. The service was great. The food delicious. Ample reading material and the ICE entertainment provided more than enough distraction but the seat was too narrow and uncomfortable and the overall ambience felt cramped.,1,6th February 2015,Australia
1843,BUD-DXB and DXB-BKK in January 2015. The first leg had good service light meal with tasty food. Entertainment with small touch screen several movies and medium selection of music. On the second leg I flew with the new A380-800 a very nice and spacious plane more legroom large touchscreen a huge number of movies music games. Disappointed by only one meal also not very tasty (chicken changee). Back from BKK to BUD with the same type of airplanes this time two meals from BKK to DXB. All flights in time polite staff and good service.,10,6th February 2015,Romania
1844,In December I flew from Zurich to Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were all very short and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. The return trip with a 777 was also disappointing. Emirates could not seat us together on the 6 hrs flight despite that we booked under the same booking reference number. Will never fly with them again unless I have no other option.,1,6th February 2015,Switzerland
1845,"Last October I flew from Amsterdam to Jakarta through Dubai. I was excited to fly the A380. However my excitement quickly turned into disappointment after experiencing the absolute crankiness of the cabin crew. Although never really rude the flight stewardesses were pretty much all very short almost 'bitchy' and only busy with themselves. Their body language and facial expressions were often as if they'd rather be somewhere else and as if were a constant nuisance. The A380 (AMS-DUB) itself is a very nice plane spacious and modern. The onboard entertainment was pretty good and the extra touch were the cameras outside the plane so you could watch the outside surroundings from your screen in front of you. Between Dubai and Jakarta they use a Boeing 777. Another disappointment! The plane on the inside was old seats smelled and looked like they definitely could use new fabrics. The entertainment screen was small and old (my 3 year old tablet has a better screen than that onboard the 777 of Emirates) supposedly touch screen it worked horribly even with the remote control device. Different plane and different crew but not a different mentality of the crew. From Jakarta to Dubai we flew again with the 777. Same complaints as on the way to Jakarta and on top of that when we arrived 5am in Dubai we had to get out of the plane far from the terminal building. We had to use stairs to get out and clearly the stairs weren't designed to handle such a large plane since there was quite the difference in height between the stairs and the exit door of the plane. When I asked the crew why we didn't taxi to the terminal the reply was ""there is no available gate"". This is the home base of Emirates and there is no place for its own planes? From the runway we had to take a shuttle bus to the terminal which took about 20 to 30 minutes. From there it was very confusing where to go once inside the terminal building. For my girlfriend and I this was the first and last time we used Emirates.",5,28th January 2015,Netherlands
1846,RUH-DXB-MRU and back. Aug 15 RUH-DXB left Riyadh on time at 9.25 pm on a 777-300 ER. Service was excellent and the staff were kind! There were a few food choices (it was a short 1.5 hr flight) and I think it was Chicken Biriani or Fish. I had the Biriani and it was excellent (but spicy!). The IFE was very good and kept me entertained. We arrived to Dubai and they gave us fast track cards but we didn't need that since we were transiting in DXB for about 3 hrs. DXB was very busy and noisy. Arrived to the lounge and it was packed with barely anywhere to sit! Finally found a place near the buffet but it was pretty noisy. Our flight to MRU left at 3.10am (on the 16th and again on time so EK are pretty good at being on schedule) on an A380. It was a pretty nice plane but I had a few problems with the cabin and seat. The mini bar on the left (or right depends on where you're sitting) of the seat is pretty bulky and makes the seat more narrow and quite uncomfortable to sleep as it's quite tight (but it was a flat bed so I'll give it points for that). Another problem was that the cabin for Business was huge! It barely felt like Business from the amount of seats in the cabin! I sat in the smaller cabin on the back so I didn't have the problem that much and it didn't affect the service of the staff but it makes Business less premium. Once again the IFE and food service were excellent. For the lounge in the back of the deck I really enjoyed that! On the return flight I left MRU in the evening so I didn't have to sleep on that flight (and it was pretty much the same thing but the cabin was much busier). I didn't go to the lounge in the DXB layover since it was from 12.00 am to about 7:00 am and I took a room in the airport hotel. The DXB-RUH flight was normal but the IFE was more outdated. I would say it was pretty good but there were a few flaws with the A380.,2,26th January 2015,Saudi Arabia
1847,We flew A380 to Dubai then 777 to Bangkok. Both flights on time. Loved the A380 it was so spacious we sat in row 88 at the back. The A380 was really quiet too. The 777 felt more cramped and was not as comfy. The IFE is brilliant both touch screens. Finally the food. We fly long haul twice a year but the Emirates food is by far the best we have had. Can't wait to fly with them again.,9,26th January 2015,United Kingdom
1848,Series of Trips on EK MEL-CMB-MEL and CMB-CAI-CMB. All sectors in Business except DXB-CMB which was in First. Check in Good. Lounges not bad. However the quality of food in DXB has been going down over time. Good Welcome on Boarding. IFE is AVOD and excellent as always. Staff can be hit or miss mostly a miss. The quality of meals on board keeps going down every month. Bread basket is brought around only when you are nearly done with the main. Of all the sectors I flew the food on EK 650 First Class from DXB to CMB was the worst. The curry sauce which accompanied the rice tasted like chillies mixed with water. Depending on how much you pay for ticket it is still value for money. But EK is on a steep downward spiral. And if you have any comments or complains post flight and write to their customer service desk do not be surprise if you get a watered down response which is a border line insult.,5,23rd January 2015,Australia
1849,DXB-Seattle J class. Overall good solid experience Chauffeurs on all legs were on time and pleasant. Flights on time. Lounges as usual in DXB good with great offering of food and beverage. In Seattle you had to ring a bell and a man would appear from behind a curtain to give you a drink (obviously economizing) no food. Crews on outward leg helpful and professional. Crew on return looked bored and tired and no smiles. Overall good experience. Business with Emirates is I feel is generally a solid product.,5,23rd January 2015,United Arab Emirates
1850,LHR-DXB-BKK Economy. Check-in pretty efficient in T3. The flight was full (as usual) with Emirates and left on time. The A380 is much quieter than the 777 but there's not much difference in the seats/space. Cabin service on Emirates is variable depending on the crew and this one was OK - nothing special. Economy food has improved recently and quite tasty. Good choice of drinks and frequent water/juice runs. On time into DXB and A380's park at the gate instead of remote stands which makes connections easier. I got upgraded to Business on the DXB-BKK leg again an A380 which was about 30mins late. The best part of Business on Emirates is a priority pass for immigration in BKK. The cabin service in Business was nothing special and I prefer to eat in the lounge rather than on the flight. Good IFE - there's always something worth watching on Emirates.,7,23rd January 2015,United Kingdom
1851,The flight from Hamburg to Dubai was two hours delayed and service on board started 25 hours after take-off. I pushed the service button in order to receive some water for taking medicine the only thing that happened was that after ten minutes a Stewardess came by switched of the service sign and went away. I pushed the button a second time and the same happened again. Furthermore there was only once service on an 8 hours flight. Food unfortunately below standard. The Entertainment System was quite ok though. Hope that I don't have to fly with Emirates again.,1,23rd January 2015,Germany
1852,FRA-DXB-BKK-DXB-FRA. Must take EK again for the flight to Bangkok due to the best price base on 6 months advance booking. FRA-DXB on A380 nice aircraft-flight full but still roomy DXB-BKK on B777 did not get the selected seats (even those seats are selected 6 months in advance by the time of booking on EK Tool) EK has changed our seats and we did not sit together/flight full - no more to say about the 3-4-3 seating. Worst service of all sectors slow service we requested water but were told to wait for the next service. BKK-DXB-FRA on A380/B777 flight full our choice of foods ran out on every sector. I've flown Emirates over a period of six years and I can definitively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Its route networks and frequencies are very good and its fares (if booking at least 3 months in advance) can be competitive. However EK progressively gets worse. EK is still on cutting back massively on quality example no amenity kits for Y class foods (quality and quantity) is getting worse cutting the Skywards-mileage counts too small number of cabin crews in Y cabin and they are disinterested in passenger service avoid service to passengers disregards the calling sign. Very chaotic and very slow on board-services choice of foods ran out very early no organization. All those bad on board services EK fare is no more valuable for money. Only IFE is the best.,5,23rd January 2015,Germany
1853,DXB - IAD [Washington DC] in January 2015 economy class. Given the only choice on this direct route is either Emirates or United it's not really much in the way of competition - give me Emirates every time. Emirates has an excellent on-demand in-flight entertainment system decent food efficient multi-lingual staff amenity packs in economy on long-haul flights and all drinks except champagne are complementary in economy. No one really wants to be stuck on a plane for 15 hours but it's on these really long routes that the little extras on Emirates - especially the in-flight entertainment system and power outlets for every seat - come into their own.,6,23rd January 2015,United Arab Emirates
1854,We flew in August 2014 from Rio de Janeiro - Dubai and Dubai to Shanghai. We travelled with 2 children (3 months and 26 months). On our first flight the toddlers TV was broken so he used my husbands and mine couldn't be used as we had the bassinet for our baby. Staff were friendly though. One our second flight my seat didn't recline I was promised at the start of the flight that they could manually do it after the meal was served so I thought that was reasonable after the meal however they told me it couldn't be done I would just have to accept it. So for an 8 hour flight I sat upright with a baby on my lap as he wasn't allowed to use the bassinet most of the time because of turbulence. However our toddler slept in his aviation approved car seat that their telephone service agents said we couldn't use. I think their customer service needs improving they tried to tell me I needed to buy 2 seats to use one car seat for a toddler whose seat I had already purchased. However at the airport everything was ok due to a nice customer agent who was able to place all our family together when again customer service had placed us all separately. The airline didn't live up to the expectation that we had and we fly long haul several times per year.,4,21st January 2015,China
1855,Flew from DXB-KUL. Flight was onboard B777-300ER. Everything from boarding until touch-down was excellent. Friendly and attentive cabin crew excellent IFE comfortable chairs fine meals smooth flight and the experience was excellent. I would definitely consider flying Emirates economy class again.,9,21st January 2015,Kuwait
1856,We were a party of eight travelling to Male via Dubai on the 20 December 2014 for two magical weeks in the Maldives. Going out had a 3hr stopover in Dubai which was changed to 3hr 40 minutes Our return flight times were good leaving Dubai at 2.35pm. 5 week before we were due to travel we were advised Emirates had changed their flight schedule meaning our flight from Male did not leave enough time to transfer the luggage from one flight to another. The only option we were given was a 12.5 hr delay or return a day early from our holiday We ended up using Dubai connect which was not good experience. We paid quite a bit more to go with Emirates than another leading airline. Never again.,1,19th January 2015,United Kingdom
1857,LHR-DXB-PER-DXB-LHR. The trip out to Perth was almost a tale of two different airlines. LHR-DXB on the A380. The Heathrow lounge is dull and there was little sign of staff. It was not made clear that boarding would be straight from the lounge. Once on board a welcome drink was proposed but never arrived. No amenities kit was offered. The plastic bags they put the headphones etc in look cheap and nasty. The much-vaunted wireless IFE controller would not unlock from its dock so not much use. 3 different cabin staff said they would deal with it but nothing was achieved. Meal service was unduly slow. No drinks served (as promised) before the end of the flight. The promised Dubai gate information on IFE channel 94 didn't materialise. Yes it was business class but it was all very impersonal and irritating. The toilets are just by the bar area so if you are queuing you are mixed up with the bar clients - not a comfortable arrangement. DXB-PER on a B777 was totally different: perfect service and everything worked. PER-DXB the seatbelt adjuster didn't work and couldn't be fixed and they eventually cobbled something together with an extender - a bit embarrassing to be presented with that in front of other passengers. Again the IFE controller didn't work. We got to the Dubai area on schedule then had to hold for 40 minutes due to congestion. When we landed we were parked at a (very) remote stand which meant a long bus ride to the terminal. Terminal 3 is enormous and impersonal and there was no time left to do any duty free shopping. DXB-LHR was ok. The IFE controller didn't work - again! So all in all I'm not that satisfied with Emirates. There seems to be a lack of attention to detail. I've flown LHR-PER once a year for the past 10 years and have used Qantas Singapore Malaysian and Qatar all in business class. I'd rank Emirates at the bottom of this list. It'll be back to Qatar next year.,7,19th January 2015,United Kingdom
1858,Whilst I noticed the narrower seating (Being 777) on my way to London (Emirates) I was lucky then to have a corner seat right in the area which is usually reserved for parents with small children. But yesterday I arrived back in Perth from Dubai on an 11-hour flight on the same Boeing 777-300ER and my coccyx and lower back are still aching from the narrow seating. I can only say I am going to carefully consider my next flight maybe even save up for 2nd class. Cattle class is just that I am not obese but have wide hips and shoulders and I am above average height. The seats on the Boeing 777-300ER were a good 2.5 inches narrower than on the remainder of my particular flight ( Dubai London) legroom is less and the back can only be minimally adjusted. Sleep is impossible. Service was very average crew seemed to be permanently engaged in jockeying their unwieldy carts in that narrower passage-ways food options ran out quickly. The entertainment options do not make up for the unpleasantness of the entire experience. Of course comfort is supplied to the higher-paying customers. I really do resent this! Will try and check out the plane-type before flying again.,2,19th January 2015,Australia
1859,Flew on their B777-300ER for a short trip to DMM. Aircraft was far more comfortable than the older 777-300s. IFE was pretty much best in class however I did not find their meals particularly great. Decent airline overall but definitely slightly over hyped.,10,19th January 2015,Saudi Arabia
1860,Great legroom even when the passenger in front reclines back. Cabin crew were friendly. Food was okay. Emirates has the widest inflight entertainment. However the seat width is not really wide as compared to other airlines. In a nutshell all 4 flights I took (Singapore to Dubai Dubai to Glasgow and the return flights) were good.,8,14th January 2015,Singapore
1861,I flew from Dubai to Mumbai on EK502 on 1st Jan 2015. I had a confirmed internet check in with seat numbers allocated. When I arrived at the counter I was told that they were over booked and I had to defer my flight. They informed me that the confirmed check in was not valid till a boarding pass was issued. I had to wait until the boarding time before they called me and offered a seat right at the back of the plane and not the one I reserved at time of online check in. Looks like they don't honor their online check in system.,8,14th January 2015,Australia
1862,This was my first time with Emirates and did not find it worth all the hype and pricey tickets. Traveled on an A380 on 3 legs of our trip and seat size + legroom was not very comfortable for a 14 hour flight. There is hardly any space to stretch or walk around a bit on the flight. Staff was courteous and polite however service wasn't quick enough but I think that's just due to the number of passengers on the flight. At one point it took them more than an hour to collect our plates after we finished our meal. Food was okay nothing great or exceptional. In- flight entertainment was the only best part about the flight screen is great plus they have a good collection of movies etc.,9,14th January 2015,United States
1863,DFW-DXB-BOM: Booked Emirates as it was the cheapest and got a very good deal. The aircraft from Dallas was A380 which cannot be doubted on its comfort. I requested an exit row seat and got it. Food was very good and tasty from Dallas to Dubai. However cabin crew didn't respond for long on 2 occasions I called through my seat button. Service from Dubai to Mumbai was okayish nothing great to talk about. Old Boeing 777-300 which was stinking. I think Emirates doesn't focus properly on one of its major markets India with respect to quality and service. Overall I would give 3.5 stars to Emirates. 4 for DFW-DXB leg and 3 for DXB-BOM leg. I got value for money since I got a very low fare.,3,14th January 2015,United States
1864,We traveled from Barcelona to Dubai and back over the Christmas holidays on the Emirates 380 and on to S. Africa on their Boeing 777 all Business Class. The service and quality of food and beverages on all flights were way above the standard of any airline we have flown. Some speak of Emirates going that extra mile - ten would be more like it. From start to finish Emirates has it covered. Other airlines could take a leaf from their book on their lounges quality of food and staff training.,5,14th January 2015,Honduras
1865,Returned from Dubai to Newcastle on the 23rd November 2014. Our inflight entertainment system did not work. The staff tried resetting it but this did not cure the problem. Eventually I was offered another seat which I declined as we were travelling as a couple I did not wish to move without my husband. When the hot meal was served we choose the chicken which was cold. Mentioned this to the staff who offered another meal but declined this. Beware they have got too big to care.,8,14th January 2015,United Kingdom
1866,DUB-DXB-DEL. The flight from Dublin was delayed which meant I was a bit worried about my connecting flight from Dubai as I only had about 2 hours transit but transit was pretty smooth. I had a positive experience with the security staff at Dubai airport - the guy who checked me was polite and smiled. Compared to Doha airport Dubai seemed a lot better organized. This was my first time transiting through Dubai and I was impressed. The food on both flights was decent without being outstanding. For vegetarians Air India and Jet Airways definitely offer a superior product. The staff on the Delhi flight neglected to distribute immigration forms which meant that the foreigners on the flight had to try and find forms at Delhi airport which was hard as they seemed to have run out. A helpful passenger had an extra form and I was saved. Overall I would say the flight was okay without being anything special - about the same as Qatar Airways.,10,14th January 2015,United Kingdom
1867,I flew from Adelaide to Paris a couple of days ago. Having heard of the really good reputation of Emirates I was looking for to it. I was rapidly disappointed with a very basic service more than average food and their ICE entertainment system really not user friendly with a lack of movie choices. By experience there are far better airlines on offer for a better price too. Travelling back to Australia in a couple of weeks hopefully they will prove me wrong.,5,11th January 2015,Australia
1868,DXB-MXP in First. Everything 5 star level boarding with separate F class bus and private suite enables you to join a high level of comfort and privacy. Crew professionalism impressed me I was always called by name from the Purser. Once seat is converted into a bed it is soft and comfortable. EK F class product is far away from all Europeans and can only compete with LH. Highly recommended.,7,11th January 2015,Italy
1869,MXP-DXB-BKK-DXB in Business. As usual I found the biz product to be excellent both on A380 and on B773. VIP lounge in Milan is brand new with plenty of seats and amenities with direct separate boarding directly from the lounge. Once on board seats are very comfortable high quality food and drinks smiles and kindness from all the crew. The only weakness is concerning boarding procedures at Bangkok that don't allow priority at all once pre-boarded is all chaotic so you have to literally walk over economy class passengers. EK is one of the most comfortable J class in the market I'll fly with them again.,8,11th January 2015,Italy
1870,A380 Dubai - Melbourne. Seated in exit row 52 although some kind of fridge malfunction had soaked the floor so we had to use blankets in order not to get wet - it being a full flight and already in exit row wasn't really going to give it up. Food was slightly disappointing - still perfectly edible but nothing special. IFE was great for TV loads of series but fewer movies. Inflight WIFI is a nice touch although it took me 10 hours to log on. I sent them a complaint email about the wet floor during the flight which I think is pretty good. Overall - the Qantas-Emirates tie up is great for Europe to Australia especially with the overnight timings of the flights and A380's going all directions. Emirates also a solid choice for service.,1,11th January 2015,United Kingdom
1871,I flew twice with Emirates in December - Bangkok-Dubai-Gatwick returning Heathrow-Dubai-Bangkok then again Bangkok-Dubai-Istanbul and return. Their inflight entertainment options are above average although their headsets were broken 50% of the time. Other than this I am sad to say on both flights I was disappointed with all aspects of their service. Our group were always split in the most odd fashion - even on our business class flight I was separated several rows apart which made no sense. Food options ran out on one flight - chicken or lamb my parents cannot eat lamb but they ran out of chicken - no alternative or other option! We were no where near the back row so obviously many other passengers only had lamb as an option! There are far better options out there for similar prices or cheaper. Don't make the mistake I made - don't fly Emirates if you have other options.,1,11th January 2015,Thailand
1872,LGW-DXB-SIN. Plane 2 hours late leaving LGW due to late inbound arrival. Fog at DXB extended delay to 3 hours including an abortive attempt at landing. Landed 03.15 exactly the time onward flight to SIN should have been taking off. That flight had closed so missed connection. Incredibly difficult to get rebooked. Long queues at transfer desk. Staff did not have ability to make re bookings directly but had to call their reservations department somewhere else in airport. Long long waits to get a response (half hour plus for each passenger) and no queuing system on their telephones. No offer to arrange hotels even though some passengers clearly becoming distressed at length of queuing time. To cap it all I later found that my connection was still on the ground when I arrived in DXB and did not leave for another 2 hours even though shown as flight closed i.e.they had allocated my paid for and checked in seat to someone else!,9,5th January 2015,United Kingdom
1873,My journey from Bangkok to London Gatwick return was the best journey I have had. On all sectors LGW-DXB-BKK and BKK-DXB-LGW I had a pleasant flight. Flight crew were extremely helpful smiling all the time food and drinks were served on time and food was surprisingly tasty. Fleet that served us on different legs of the journey were as following LGW-DXB was on B777-300ER DXB-BKK was on A380-800 BKK –DXB was on A380-800 DXB-LGW was on B777-300ER. Seating arrangements on both Emirates B777-300ER and A380-800 is 3-4-3 I have always considered these seating arrangements to be very cramped. Surprisingly Emirates somehow made it feel specious with plenty of leg room. Entertainment on board both B777-300ER and A380-800 was wonderful with over 1000 channels of entertainment to choose from flying cannot get boring. If you do manage to get bored then many of the Emirates B777 and A380 are fitted with inflight WIFI internet OnAir at a very reasonable price. I paid £0.63 for 600mb that's enough to last me on all my sectors. Overall I enjoyed everything Emirates had to offer staff were very helpful on board and on ground. Services offered on board were more than I expected. Entertainment food and drinks on board were by the best I have had so far on an aeroplane. I would definitely recommend flying with Emirates if you haven't flown before.,5,5th January 2015,United Kingdom
1874,Flew HAM-DXB-BLR and returned BLR-DXB-HAM in mid-December 2014 with Emirates. Before taking this flight I'd heard the hype about Emirates being one of the best airlines so was looking forward to the trip. How far could the reality be from the hype? A long way. Where to begin? The seats are not comfortable stewardesses missed me twice when bringing drinks around and once when bringing meals (I wasn't asleep they just didn't ask and were looking away from me so I couldn't get their attention until I had to practically shout at them - which got an angry- looking glare). On the return leg from BLR to DXB I got a nosebleed in flight and wanted to ask them for tissues - I used the call button but nobody came. Waited several minutes then tried again this went on until the bleeping stopped after about 15 minutes. Not one attendant came to repeated buzzing over that time. Finally it stopped and I got out of my window seat and to the toilet to take care of it myself. I noticed during the flights to BLR and on the return that there were plenty of other people who also got no responses to their calls - they finally gave up or I saw a couple of them get up from their seats and find an attendant themselves - so ignoring passengers seems to be corporate policy. Meals are also average. All-in-all not a good experience over 4 flights with this airline - I would not recommend flying with them - I sure won't if I can avoid it.,10,5th January 2015,Germany
1875,EK0015 8th Dec. Flew from UK via Dubai to Capetown. Had to travel for work urgently. Last minute booking was easy and good app. Brightervisas secured my SA visa so I was away quickly. Was able to get 15% off loads of things with Skywards membership and the seats and service was great. Downside was the tea but coffee was OK. On return 1 hour delay due to late passenger which was not great but service was top level.,6,31st December 2014,United Kingdom
1876,Travelled on DEL-DXB and DXB-Lagos sector. Aircraft on DEL-DXB sector was good. Seat comfort was ok. Food was good and staff courteous. DXB-Lagos sector aircraft was old seats were not that comfortable. However prompt and good service made up for it. Emirates business lounge in New Delhi is very good. Dubai lounge is also good.,5,31st December 2014,India
1877,NCL-DXB-TPE return in economy class 12/12 - 20/12. All 4 legs were Boeing 777-300. Managed to book the 2 seats at the rear of the plane for the entire journey. Legroom not great but managed OK. ICE entertainment system was excellent with a good choice of things to watch. Food provided was nothing to write home about - adequate would be the best term. Flight attendants were OK nothing outstanding. Polite and pleasant. This was my first time with Emirates and had been led to believe it would be an amazing experience. Turned out to be no better or worse than other carriers who fly these routes. A bit underwhelmed actually.,5,31st December 2014,United Kingdom
1878,EK 384 BKK-HKG in Business. Everything about this airline is superb. Sparkling new A380 warm professional crews nice lounge in BKK. In flight WiFi live TV great IFE bar etc. That said boarding could be improved as it was a bit chaotic.,8,31st December 2014,Australia
1879,Just flew PER-DXB-FRA. We found the overall experience to be disappointing and don't understand all the hype about Emirates being one of the best. The seats were narrow and hard which made them very uncomfortable for long flights. Qantas has way better seats. The food was average nothing to note at all. The biggest disappointment was with the unfriendly soulless cabin crew on both flights. Barely a smile out of any of them. They looked like they were dead walking just going through the motions of their jobs. One in fact entertained us by digging around for ear wax a few times and then flicking into the aisle. She was gross! Not at all what we were expecting. Maybe our return flights will be better?,8,29th December 2014,Australia
1880,We flew to Istanbul via Dubai on the 01/12/2014 and back on 10/12/2014. There were no problem with the flight itself but we found out afterwards that you get hotel vouchers if you have a stay over longer then 8 hours in Dubai. We had a 10 hours stay over at Dubai to Istanbul and a 12 hours over stay from Istanbul at Dubai. No where we was informed regarding the hotel vouchers-I am sure that I do not have to explain how tired we were. The staff when we bought our tickets should have notified us regarding this. We also only found out about the food vouchers by luck on the internet.,1,29th December 2014,South Africa
1881,Dubai-Melbourne. First trip on A380 and it was fantastic. Allocated Business class seat on window in row 25 so just a short walk to the fantastic bar area. Seating and amenities were outstanding as was the service from a truly international crew. Entertainment system was the best I have ever used with a wide selection of movies and the flight tracking is brilliant. Food was as good as I have ever had on a flight and there was indeed plenty of it. Overall a wonderful flight and have no hesitation in recommending Emirates Business Class.,6,29th December 2014,Australia
1882,EK 385 HKG-BKK in Business Class. Hard to find many in any faults in this service. Spectacularly equipped A380 with comfortable cabin seating remarkable IFE choices with high resolution screen. Business class bar a nice diversion from the in seat activities service was very attentive and professional. Food and wine perhaps a tad below the rest of the experience but overall very hard to top this on the short run from HKG-BKK.,8,22nd December 2014,Australia
1883,KUL-MEL-KUL. The outbound flight to MEL was perfect and in-flight service was top notch. However the inbound flight to KUL was less than ideal. There was at least a 75 minute delay out of MEL. I think this is to do with day-light saving time (1hr) in MEL plus a bit more. I think it is the airlines responsibility to adjust and advertise the correct departure times in cases such as this. I was not informed when I checked in over the web or the counter staff at the baggage drop. However given the price out of KL I would fly this airline again.,10,22nd December 2014,Malaysia
1884,My Husband and I travelled on Emirates on DEL-DXB-NCE-CDG-DXB-DEL between 8th and 16th December and were disappointed with the service that the airline offered. The DEL-DXB and DXB-DEL flights were the most horrible that I have encountered so far. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. On our DEL-DXB flight I requested for water thrice but it never came and on my third request I was rudely told by the staff that she can't give me water as she had other priorities to take care of. It was a clear sign that Emirates is not interested in taking care of its flyers. Our flight from CDG-DXB was also not great as the supply of water and juices was intermittent. However I have high regards for the crew flying on DXB-NCE flight on the morning of 8th December. They were courteous helpful and very prompt in their service. They made our journey special with a small pastry when they got to know that we were newlyweds. But this was plain luck as the rest three legs of the journey were very disappointing and we have decided not to fly Emirates again. The attitude of the staff clearly showed that passengers should not expect after sales service once they have paid for their tickets.,4,22nd December 2014,India
1885,I flew Business Class Dubai to Casablanca return (777-300) and Dubai to Addis Ababa return (A330-200) last month. All flights were on time cabin crew and service excellent meals pretty good. I really couldn't fault them. The angled lay flat seat on the 777-300 is comfy and I never fully recline it to flat - I find it much more comfortable to put it into a kind of almost lying down lazy boy chair so both ends raised slightly off flat. While I've read many poor reviews on the Business class seats in the A330-200 I have to say I found it very comfy. It definitely doesn't stack up against their long haul A380 seats or even the 777-300 but I was very comfortable with the deep recline great footrests ( so much room) and comfy leather seats. These aircraft's are usually only used on their shorter flights and in this situation I have no problems.,6,22nd December 2014,Australia
1886,LHR-DBX-SIN A380. Emirates A380 is a brilliant product. I flew economy - and it was arguably the best cabin experience. Spacious great inflight entertainment comfortable seat amazingly lit cabin at night and great food. It was really difficult to fault. The staff were friendly and helpful got some great sleep on the flight too - and there's really not much else to say! Would highly recommend.,1,18th December 2014,Australia
1887,EK204-EK304 JFK-DXB-PVG. We are skywards members. Departure time is 12:05AM Delayed for about 4 hours. We would not make our connection flight to Shanghai. The staff in New York only gave us one choice which was fly to Hong Kong from Dubai then transfer the flight back to Shanghai in Hong Kong. We asked them for next flight from Dubai to Shanghai but they said that they can not find the tickets in their system. The A380 from JFK to DXB is ok. Entertainment is the best of all airlines. The seat for A380 have more legroom than the 777. Food is fantastic. Three meals served. You can order beverages or snacks any time on board. I still recommend Emirates.,10,18th December 2014,China
1888,DUB-DXB 773 fantastic. New high quality equipment with great attention to detail from very professional staff. Connection to BKK flight in DXB international was a disgrace. Was looking forward to flying the A380 but experience was just not the same 20% of the staff did very little while the others were extremely busy on a very full flight. Conclusion other airlines should take note.,10,18th December 2014,United Kingdom
1889,We flew from LGW to DXB (777-300) stopped in DXB for 3 days and flew onwards from DXB to BNE (A380) as we'd heard good reviews of Emirates and wanted to see a little of UAE. Emirates offered the best price and connections to/from Australia and New Zealand. Really disappointing LGW to DXB service - staff were rude had no personality and seemed rushed. Food was average and entertainment not much better. We left the flight in DXB more than willing to give them a second chance to impress on the longer DXB-BNE sector (14hrs on the A380) but more of the same. Staff were rude unfriendly seemed rushed to complete service more concerned with doing their make-up (we were sat next to the galley) than much else. Really poor. We're flying back CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LGW and to say that we're looking forward to it would be misleading. Compared to other long-haul flights we've flown (Air NZ Virgin Atlantic Singapore BA) Emirates are by far and away the worst - unless it seems you are lucky to be a Gold member when they can't do enough for you.,6,10th December 2014,United Kingdom
1890,CPT-DXB-LHR. Appalling start in the Bidvest 'Premier' lounge at CPT stuffed to the gills and poor quality food and drink. FAs friendly enough on 777-300ER but dinner service slow and the 2-3-2 seats lacked privacy for a night-time flight. 4 hr stopover at DXB fine once the gate for A380 flight to LHR had been identified - no thanks to a discourteous DXB employee. A380 impressively quiet as ever and a pair of E/F seats were excellent for a couple. Lunch service again slow and the main courses inedible. Flight deck poor at updating on flight including bad turbulence. Quick disembarkation and speedy baggage reclaim.,1,10th December 2014,United Kingdom
1891,"Not sure why Qantas decided to partner with Emirates - terrible deal for Qantas customers! Travelling from Dubai to New York on the A380 I bought paid for the WiFi access and used it for about 5 minutes before it went off. When I complained to the onboard service director she told me that Emirates was not responsible for the service and that I needed to write to ""inner"" the service provider. This was absolutely shocking - in my opinion Emirates is responsible for every service offered on it's flights. Also flying from LHR to Dubai on a night flight my seat was damaged and wouldn't recline so having paid for a first class seat I was unable to get a nights rest (the aircrew told me that they knew the seat was damaged before the flight left but that the engineer was unable to fix it). The flight was full so I was unable to be relocated but I would have preferred to have been given the choice of another flight - this is what Qantas would have done. Put simply I believe that Emirates have placed far too much emphasis on growth and not enough on keeping customers happy. Given the available alternatives and the cost of air tickets I for one will not be flying Emirates anymore.",1,10th December 2014,Australia
1892,EK 772 CPT to DXB. Flight was on a Boeing 777-300. Boarding was on time and it was fast. Take off about 30 minutes late but even with almost 30 minutes holding time in DXB plane was still on time or schedule. Crew was nice and food choices was matched. I even got a second hot meal as I was still hungry. Bags were on belt when we arrived there. Only downturn was that the full plane got a remote stand and we had to take the bus to the terminal which took almost another 30 minutes. Would fly EK again since the legroom was great in economy.,9,10th December 2014,Germany
1893,Check in staff at Gatwick were first class and helpful. Boarding was late but no idea why. On the flight the seats were comfortable and meal ok. Staff were not very forthcoming with service! Drinks not offered had to ask for them and was left waiting for over 30 mins holding used cups as no one answered my call bell. On return from Dubai check in staff not very helpful onboard staff - same problem. Slow to answer call bell seats not very comfortable and no drinks offered except with meal. Breakfast omelette was cold and so was the tea. This certainly wasn't up to the standard I was expecting from Emirates given their reputation of being a first class airline.,1,10th December 2014,United Kingdom
1894,EK 57 DXB to DUS Boeing 777-300 with the older ICE AVOD but still enough. Plane was on time both departing and arriving. Food and Beverages service was great. Ice cream was served as well. The crew was fantastic and very friendly they did a great job. Bags on belt took almost 45 minutes but that is a typical DUS Airport problem. Legroom was great again better than other airlines in Europe.,10,10th December 2014,Germany
1895,BKK-Istanbul-Johannesburg. The A380 BKK-Dubai leg was very comfortable the widebody offered plenty of room to stretch out. The B777 on the Dubai-JNB leg was dated and the IFE screen did not work properly on the JNB-Dubai leg. The service offered by the cabin crew on all flights was excellent. The entertainment system (ICE) is the best I've experienced. The only thing that they need to improve on is the meal portion size.,7,10th December 2014,Thailand
1896,Vienna-Dubai-Manila and return in Business all on B777. Emirates is decent 4-star airline. The night flight out of Vienna was as one would expect - quick dinner service (good meal but nothing special) friendly staff (always addressed me with my name) but seats are far too narrow for business class because Emirates squeezes a middle seat into the centre row. On arrival in Dubai we were bussed to the gate (out of 4 arrivals/take-offs 3 were from bus gates and the bus ride takes quite a while). The business lounge was a disappointment. It is fairly large as it stretches across almost the whole first floor of the terminal but it is rather narrow and dull it overlooks the shopping concourse below (noise) there are showers but they are tiny. Strangely I had to ask for a non- alcoholic beverage at the bar as only juice and water are freely supplied but all hard drinks are self-serve. The onward flight to Manila was on a noticeably older 777 in a two-class configuration. The staff performance on this flight was outstanding. On the return flight one of only two washrooms for C-class broke which lead to queues. The plane was spotless and new but cabin crew performance was below par. Coats and jackets were handed back some 30 to 40 minutes before landing some pax had to keep them over their knees as the adjoining seat was occupied. Drinks and snacks were taken away all of a sudden without warning due to landing (still some 30 minutes away). Generally I would recommend them although I still prefer Qatar or Turkish when travelling into Asia.,7,4th December 2014,Austria
1897,MAN-DXB-CPT in business class. The chauffeur service on time. The Manchester lounge was one of the best lounges I've ever used. The flight to DXB was the A380 - the business seats and service are very good. We never bothered with the bar at the back but it did look good. The business lounge at DXB was fairly gruesome to be honest. To crowded dirty and quite a let down after Manchester. The flight to CPT was a 777-300ER. The seats and facilities are not a patch on the A380 still much better than economy. The service was better probably due to the fewer business class passengers. The return flight was all 777-300ER on both legs. Again the seats weren't the best but the food and service on all the legs was generally very good. The chauffeur service was excellent. Our bags turned up first both at CPT and MAN. Overall a very positive experience.,9,4th December 2014,United Kingdom
1898,Flew Emirates MAN-DXB-KUL and back. A380 from MAN-DXB and B777-300ER from DXB-KUL andmB777-300ER for all legs back to MAN from KUL. The overall flight experience is below average. The seat was OK and a bit weary and some seats had visible stains. The aisle was too narrow the meal cart always hit the the aisle seats every time the cabin crew served the meal. The meal was below average nothing impressive about it. The crew have to learn to be more friendly and definitely need more training to communicate with the passengers. Toilets were fairly dirty after a few hours and crew couldn't be bothered to look after them. The only good thing about the flight experience was the entertainment system. I am totally disappointed as I was expecting Emirates to be one of the best airlines in the world.,4,4th December 2014,United Kingdom
1899,JED-DXB-HYD the trip from JED to Dubai the plane was an A380. The economy seat was quite comfortable and the service was good. The food was outstanding and I liked the ceiling LED lights which give a look of stars. Dubai to Hyderabad was a B777-300ER - the inflight entertainment and the breakfast was good and as usual the service was good.,7,4th December 2014,India
1900,JED-DXB-HYD the trip from JED to Dubai the plane was an A380. The economy seat was quite comfortable and the service was good. The food was outstanding and I liked the ceiling LED lights which give a look of stars. Dubai to Hyderabad was a B777-300ER - the inflight entertainment and the breakfast was good and as usual the service was good.,10,4th December 2014,India
1901,MAD-DXB-SYD economy. A380 great seats B777 impossible seats very uncomfortable. Cabin crew poor. Food is good. At gates in Australia the staff were also poor.,9,4th December 2014,Spain
1902,"SYD to DXB in Business and upgraded to First with Skywards miles from DXB to MCR. Business was OK - Slight problem with hand controls for ICE which couldn't be resolved. Minor inconvenience. Staff were efficient and tried to help. Always enjoy the small bar/lounge at the rear of the plane. Good to stretch legs and meet people. Food was fair though nothing special. Seat is a little narrow when lie flat but infinitely better than economy. First Class Lounge in DXB was disappointing. Apart from table service for eating I think that the Business Lounge is better. In First there is also a large ""Smoking area"" which I was amazed at. It is not enclosed and the awful smell permeates into the eating areas. Would not recommend. Flight to MCR in First was good. Privacy is appreciated and the crew were very attentive when you wanted them. Touched down at MCR and was through Passport Control and baggage recovery in record time. Chauffeur Drive was a nice finishing touch.",8,4th December 2014,United Kingdom
1903,Boston - Dubai - Mumbai. The long haul 777's economy section is scandalous. It's the equivalent of flying on a cramped domestic airplane for 14 hours. Honestly I have flown many international trips in Economy and never have I been this uncomfortable. In a standard seat it is so narrow that I had to take turns eating with the passenger next to me because neither of us had enough arm room to cut food. There was absolutely no back support in the 'new and improved' economy seats and the 3-4-3 seating is too much for the 777 – so much so that the flight attendants do not even apologize when they hit your seat every time they walk by you in the narrow aisles. On the way from Dubai back to Boston my entertainment touchscreen misregistered every tap meaning that any time I went to pause a movie the system either exited rewound to the beginning or switched to a view of the map. It is clear that Emirates the is flying on a reputation clearly earned before its new-found desire for profit over passenger well being. Like American domestics they will now punish the passenger for the benefit of their bottom line. Unfortunately I will not fly Emirates again if they continue their push for more and more seats in Economy.,2,4th December 2014,United States
1904,BKK-DXB-Moscow. Excellent flight on the way to Moscow entertainment system is excellent with plenty of choices food was very good excellent service. On the way back from Moscow to Bangkok the flight from Dubai - Bangkok was delayed nearly 2 hours for technical problem on their A380 but overall Emirates is still very good. Being a gold member is excellent as the chief purser came to greet you personally before departure.,9,1st December 2014,Thailand
1905,Again a mixed experience with Emirates EK407 MEL-DUB and EK017 DXB-MAN business class both on A380. Business seat would be tight for a large person cabin crew patchy on night flight from MEL. Food wise advertised items like cheese and coffee had to be specifically requested rather than routinely provided plane from Melbourne was an hour late in to Dubai resulting in a frantic dash over a long distance to Manchester. Plane service and food better on day service.,10,25th November 2014,United Kingdom
1906,Flew Brisbane to Dubai on 777 and the onto Rome on A380. You really notice the difference between these two planes. The A380 is a lot quieter and seats are more comfortable and spacious. Would recommend sitting in the first section of economy we were rows 49 and 50. Food was of high standard and their entertainment system was fantastic. Easy to use up the time watching a couple of the late latest movies. Would highly recommend to anyone making the trip to Europe from Australia.,6,25th November 2014,Australia
1907,We have just had four flights with Emirates Gatwick /Dubai/Singapore Beijing/Dubai/Gatwick on all four flights I could not fault the cabin staff they worked very hard frequently coming round with water. The food was typical airline food re-heating an omelette is not a good idea but the warm croissants a nice touch. The seats on the air bus are very comfortable and had plenty of legroom. We had a query before our first flight with regard to seats and customer services were most helpful and resolved the situation. It was a long tiring trip made bearable by Ice the wonderful entertainment system. We were quite happy with our economy flight.,8,25th November 2014,United Kingdom
1908,Flew BKK to SYD - seat was really uncomfortable. In the upright position it felt like you were slanting forward and I could feel the metal bars in the seat. It was an 8.5hr flight and was expecting the dinner service to take place quite quickly so I could take advantage of the lie flat bed. Dinner wasn't served until well after 2hrs into the flight and was a disappointment. The staff were friendly and helpful which was great but apart from that I didn't enjoy what should have been a comfortable flight.,3,25th November 2014,United Kingdom
1909,31st October. Flew Dusseldorf to Dubai on EK 56 on a Boeing 777-300ER. Check-in and seats we booked via travel agent were honored. Check in for economy with queue was still fast and easy. Boarding was half hour later due to technical. It took them almost 15 hour before take off but no problem so far. Boarding was quick and water was served since there was no air-conditioning on the ground due to the technical. On board we got the menu card and soon drinks and snacks where served before getting lunch. Meal choices was matched and even our no lactose meals was no problem. Flight was smooth and crew came around with water and juice. In between they served ice cream that was nice. ICE avod was nice with plenty of choices. Arriving in Dubai we got a remote stand so we where bussed to terminal that was quick because they use a lot of busses and there was no waiting at all. Would fly them again seats are nice with good legroom compared to LH UA AA or BA and AF/KL.,5,20th November 2014,Germany
1910,Flew from Brussels-Dubai-Tokyo and back again a total of 34 hours on Emirates planes. Absolutely outstanding airline. The crew were immaculately turned out and very friendly. The plane was clean and the meals were delicious. The inflight entertainment was also very good with a wide choice of games/films though some of the older planes have a slightly less user friendly interface. One feature I liked was as your plane nears Dubai on the inflight entertainment screen you can see where your connecting flight gate/terminal is. Families with young kids also get complimentary strollers when they land.,2,20th November 2014,Belgium
1911,I have just completed a trip LGW to HKG on Emirates via DXB in Business Class. The London to Dubai and Dubai to London were on a 777-300ER the DXB to HKG on an A380. What a difference. The A380 was comfort personified. You are cocooned in your little area with nobody beside or immediately in front of you - I was in seat 23K. You have plenty of space with easy access out to the aisle. The 777 however felt very cramped with somebody sitting next to you. When that passenger has his seat in bed mode you have to clamber over his legs to get out to the aisle. With the A380 you have plenty of storage space with the deep side compartments. On the 777 there is no place to store anything other than the overhead locker. Up until experiencing the A380/777 difference I have never much cared about the airplane I am sitting on - from now on for me it just has to be the A380. Had I taken all legs of this trip on the A380 the marks given would be much higher in the Trip Satisfaction and Seat Comfort.,9,20th November 2014,United Kingdom
1912,1st November Dubai to Cape Town on EK 772 on a Boeing 777-300. Transfer in Dubai at night is always full but not as bad as on any other airport. Boarding was on time but had to wait for take off clearance as the pilot informed us. Flight was with snack at the beginning and a nice breakfast before landing with one meal being lactose free. Crew was nice and helpful. We got a nice sleep on the 9 hour flight. ICE Avod system was the new one with even more choices and movies. In CPT luggage was on the belt when we arrived there. Legroom was again very fine.,3,20th November 2014,Germany
1913,Brussels-Dubai. Emirates scores very low on staff service. They offered a choice between chicken or lamb on both flights but lamb was never available. They ran out of white wine coke ice but the other aspects check-in entertainment get high scores.,10,20th November 2014,Belgium
1914,Traveled Business Class to LHR - EK005 on the 5th November returning from MAN - EK022 on the 11th November 2014. The 380 flight to London had a delayed departure but this did not deter me from enjoying the flight in total. The return flight from Manchester on a 777-ER was serviced by a crew that was second to none. On both legs the quality of food served was excellent in fact I go as far to say it gets better and better every time I fly with Emirates. I am a gold Card member preferring to travel with Emirates on all my flights. Enjoying the journey with Emirates really starts in the Business lounges. The new Dubai dedicated 380 Lounge is wonderful the Manchester lounge is obviously smaller but very pleasing typical of the other Emirate lounges around the Globe.,5,17th November 2014,United Arab Emirates
1915,Outbound from ZRH-DBX-BKK. Both flights A380. Very comfortable good service. Best inflight entertainment system used many different airlines recently and Emirates is definitely best for that.,7,17th November 2014,Thailand
1916,LHR - DXB - CPT. Quick boarding of A380 direct from T3 Emirates lounge. Centre pair of seats excellent for a couple. FAs rather robotic with little warmth or humour. Dinner service slow with overcooked main course. A380 impressively quiet on upper deck. Excellent IFE but annoying that one has to use supplied noise cancelling headphones. Flat bed seats reasonably comfortable. Quick disembarkation to huge Emirates lounge at DXB. Bizarre bus journey (30 minutes!) to 770-300 on the other side of the airport for the flight to CPT. FAs again going through the motions and food service just as slow as on A380. Flight noticeably noisier. 2-3-2 business class seating arrangement affords little privacy and seats don't lie fully flat. Arrived in CPT on time with impressively fast disembarkation and baggage collection.,8,17th November 2014,United Kingdom
1917,MEL-AKL-MEL in J Class. Wonderful service on both sectors with a really varied and friendly crew on each sector. Staff were oblivious to the call button on the return leg the bight little light above my seat didn't attract anyone's attention which I found quite grating considering how professional these crew were appearing to be. The seats were extremely comfortable and although perhaps not quite as comfortable as some airlines lie flat fold over beds for sectors like this they were great. The scrambled eggs on the breakfast flight out of MEL were very disappointing and quite solid but a small grizzle. The dinner on the AKL-MEL leg was exceptional the best steak I've had in the sky! The bar at the back is a great feature it was packed coming back into MEL. For this reason I'd avoid sitting in the rear cabin the noise would be too much on a long night flight. Only real (yet again very minor in the scheme of things) complaint when our jackets were handed back as we started to descend there was nowhere to hang them around the seat. They had to lie crumpled on our lap or draped along the bins at the side. A hook in the seat back would be so handy. Would recommend anytime and aside from the couple of small complaints a perfect way to fly. Well done EK. SQ have lost themselves a regular traveller.,3,17th November 2014,Australia
1918,Flew the A380 from Kuwait - Bangkok round-trip. Best in-flight entertainment I have seen. Comfortable seats nice lounge excellent staff and would recommend flying Emirates.,10,12th November 2014,Kuwait
1919,CPT-DXB-SIN. First leg old A343 that had really old IFE and seats. Food was good and the staff welcoming. For DXB-SIN I was on a 773 that had the current cabin and I was impressed all the way. Seats were really comfortable food was good staff were great and IFE was good. The only problems were the boarding process and delay. It was weird that passengers had to sit in separate areas of the holding room for boarding also there was an hour delay. If I had the chance I will try to fly EK again.,5,12th November 2014,United States
1920,LGW to HKG return. I was pleasantly surprised with this airline. The staff were actually interested in the passengers and polite and hard working. There was no amenity kit but we did get hot towels. The food was tasty and plenty of it. Sensibly they only served a light snack on the very early departure from Dubai. We were late leaving London but made up the time and caught our connection. Plenty of films to watch. The seats were comfortable especially on the A380.It made a nice change to go from Gatwick.,10,11th November 2014,United Kingdom
1921,Recently flew AMS-DBX-BKK the first time that I deviated from my favourite SQ. Flight left AMS 75m late and approaching DBX was put in a holding pattern for over an hour. That - and the fact that the A380 was parked about 25m by bus away the terminal - left me very little time to catch my connecting flight even though I was in the second bus. Surprisingly on reaching the terminal there was no ground staff around - there must have been many people missing connections - and after security I had to walk a long distance and eventually did not make it in time. After queuing for over an hour in front of an understaffed Emirates transit desk I finally got booked onto a later flight and spent the following 5h in the Emirates Business lounge. That following flight - a 777 - left an hour late too. Was lucky that my Emirates chauffeur-drive was still available in BKK. The flights were otherwise uneventful. Seating on both planes was good but definitely less roomy than on SQ's 777. Food was OK service on board friendly. My return flight is coming up and hopefully that will be a better experience transit- wise. Will withhold my recommendation of Emirates to others till after that event. Again I was very much surprised that nobody was meeting the transit passengers arriving over 2h late. In similar situations at Changi/Singapore SQ staff is there to either get you to your plane in time or if it too late altogether make immediate arrangements to get you to your destination as soon as possible.,7,6th November 2014,Netherlands
1922,Shanghai Pudong-Dubai-Shanghai Pudong recently on A380 positive sides - amazing entertainment comfortable seat both flights on time. Downside - poor food and beverage quality no water/any food between light meal and breakfast - it's a 10hr flight! EK is far below SQ/QR or even KL in terms of service!,8,6th November 2014,China
1923,SYD-DXB-CDG-BCN-DXB-SIN all on the A380. I have just completed 4 legs internationally with this airline and could not fault them. My first leg was with a fabulous crew of young female flight attendants. I was travelling with my husband and my 9 year old daughter. My daughter was treated like an absolute princess. My daughter was given flight packs and a child's meal (which I didn't request). The service was excellent and served with a smile and professional manner. The food was lovely better than expected. The food was some of the loveliest presented airline food I have had. The cabin toilets were always kept clean and dry. The inflight entertainment ICE is second to none. The seats were Ok but as I was travelling economy I wasn't expecting a lounge room. You get what you pay for.,3,6th November 2014,Australia
1924,Used a bus to board our connecting flight to HAM at Dubai. We had to carry our baby and stand in the bus during 20-30 minutes bus ride. No seats available. We had our hand luggage as well. It was a horrible experience. We paid more money to buy the tickets from Emirates - tickets were almost half the price on another airline. It was our first time with Emirates and we expected to have good service for the price we paid. I would not recommend Emirates.,9,6th November 2014,Germany
1925,The seats are uncomfortable the staff service is poor they take along time to come when we need them. They use a big portion of time chatting with each other rather than actually serving the passengers. Slow serving meals and taking the empty trays. There should be more water and juice runs I'm unsatisfied and definitely won't recommend them to anyone I know.,7,3rd November 2014,United Arab Emirates
1926,LGW-DXB-CMB-DXB-LGW. All flights economy class on B777-300ER. My first time flying with Emirates and a good experience overall. All flights on time. Comfortable seats but on the 777 you would not want to be sat next to a large person as the seats are 10-abreast in economy rather than the usual 9. Excellent touch screen entertainment using ICE system. Very good food served. Sadly Dubai International is not big enough for the large numbers of passengers and was heaving and cramped. Overall a good experience but Singapore Airlines is still my favourite.,8,3rd November 2014,United Kingdom
1927,B777 from MAN to DXB in Economy. Ok but nothing special. Hard to get comfortable in seat and food average. Service passable but no more. Onward flight to Sydney on A380 and got a surprise but very welcome upgrade to Business Class at Boarding gate. Huge difference for a 13 hour leg. Able to sleep in lie flat seat. IFE very good on big screen and drinks top class. Service good but food only average and nothing special for Business Class.,7,3rd November 2014,United Kingdom
1928,AMS-DXB-PER with first 6h30m leg in Business on A380 and second 10h15m in First on 777-300ER. Business class on the A380 offers an excellent experience with the best IFE there is a comfortable and cosy seat that sits well in all positions (including fully-flat bed). The drinks on offer are also excellent best cappuccino there is in the clouds but the food is very average with the menu not changing often and the mains being the true letdown. Transfer at DXB T3 very efficient as always. First on the 777-300ER is truly great with private suites an excellent seat that converts in a very comfortable bed (am 192cm tall) fine a la carte dining huge tv screen. As good as it gets!,3,31st October 2014,Belgium
1929,Very good airline but unfortunately the boarding/disembarking procedures at Dubai airport are a nightmare. Except for flights operated with A380 which are parked at gates for many flights operated with B777 and A330 the airplanes are parked at remote stands which means long (20 to 40 minutes) transfers by bus between planes and the terminal building. I do not recommend flying with Emirates unless on the A380.,10,31st October 2014,Japan
1930,"Had problems with the airline even before my trip as they changed my flights. If I hadn't called them to check about something I would not have known! I flew Emirates London-Jakarta via Dubai. Flight from Heathrow was delayed by about an hour. Dubai-London flight I had the ""wake me up"" sticker at the meal time the crew ignored the sticker. Food was average; and inflight entertainment was excellent. Overall I was disappointed with the service I received as I had high expectations of Emirates. It's not as good as it used to be a few years ago.",9,31st October 2014,United Kingdom
1931,Recently flew GLA - DXB - JKT and took advantage of the special business class upgrade offer via e-mail. The new emirates lounge at Glasgow is very good even when comparing it to the Dubai business lounge. Local food was on offer and there was a wide range to choose from. Business seats on the new style 777 are very comfy and plenty of options on the ICE system. I have been offered the business upgrade 3 times and have always taking it but the major annoyance is it will not allow me to upgrade online and always results in me having to phone and explain the whole situation which takes forever.,7,31st October 2014,Indonesia
1932,Copenhagen to Manila via Dubai. The flight from Copenhagen was 1 hour delayed because of late arrival from Dubai. Boarding in Copenhagen was fast. The service from Copenhagen to Dubai on the flight was good and the ICE system working well. The boarding in Dubaifor the flight to Manila was good. The plane was one of the older models of the 777 so for the ICE system you needed to use the remote. The return flight from Manila to Dubai was good the check in was fast and nice that they are now using terminal 3. Boarding was good and first time I saw boarding using zones not used in the other airports. The plane was an old B777 and the IFE system was not working well - it was stopping in middle of movies. Flight from Dubai to Copenhagen was good was one the younger 777 plane so ICE was working with out any problems.,10,31st October 2014,Denmark
1933,Travelled EK18 MAN-DXB and EK420 on to Perth. A380 excellent - beautiful plane smooth and quiet. In business class service was patchy - better on my wife's side than mine my attendant disappeared half way through. Plane from Dubai B777 not as nice a plane but service and food excellent even managed some sleep.,4,31st October 2014,United Kingdom
1934,Compared to anything we have in the U.S. and other international airlines I've flown this organization is top- notch. Or at least they try to be. Flew the A380 JFK to Dubai and A340 Dubai to Seychelles and back again. Were upgraded to Business Class on the second leg which was absolutely amazing. The A340 seats not as comfortable as the A380 but once you're on the A380 it's hard to find anything to complain about. Service great pillows headphones blankets great entertainment. My husband enjoyed the music options and we both enjoyed the in-flight information system. Bathrooms plentiful and clean seats comfortable boarding and disembarking painless and we got our free meal vouchers in the Dubai airport and got our free meal! How many airlines do that? I hate to fly but this was definitely a treat. It was a bit pricey to say the least but you get what you pay for. I think Emirates are doing a great job. Would gladly fly them again. Customer service did their best in every area.,9,28th October 2014,United States
1935,"We recently travelled on Emirates but were disappointed that the flight home from Dubai/Adelaide was overbooked and on arrival at the check counter at 11.30pm for a 2.00am departure that we would not be able to board the flight. Our luggage was tagged and we were asked to wait until the plane was boarding to see if our seats would be available (along with 4 other passengers). With 40 mins to go we were told that we could now board and to hurry through customs immigrations and no stopping to shop so that we would make the flight. We were given EUD 100 each to spend on duty free on the flight but the crew told us that ""they were far too busy to offer any duty free items"" and this was a 12 hour flight. We still have the vouchers but what good are they to us?",8,28th October 2014,Australia
1936,Leaving on QF 1 on 12 Oct and from Dubai back to Sydney via London on Emirates planes. All sectors on A380. The aircraft is the common factor between Qantas and Emirates. But the experience is so different. The Qantas flight attendants are very professional in the way they go about their work. Emirates FA's are to a man and woman under 30 lack experience and customer skills. On EK 2 from LHR to Dubai on Saturday 18 October it was particularly bad. A couple of FA's would not have been out of place on easyJet. One fixed up her lipstick during a meal service whilst serving. On four sectors flown in the last week on Qantas and Emirates planes it can be said that Qantas came out way on top. This is not some pro Australian rant. Have been using Qantas and Emirates combination for a while now and the same result. What can Emirates do? Get some serious training for their cabin crews and some old heads on board to oversee the younger staff. At the moment they all look and act like kids serving in McDonald's. I will continue to fly Emirates as their scheduling from Australia is so good and much of my work is in the Gulf and Europe.,7,28th October 2014,Australia
1937,First and probably last time with Emirates. At least not on this connection to Beijing. EK306 arrives into Beijing at 15:10h. It is a 500 Passenger flight arriving simultaneously with other flights from Singapore Hong-Kong Dubai Doha Fukuoka and Vancouver. Immigration took nearly 2 hours due to the masses of people arriving. Chauffeur Service did not wait. Disgraceful Emirates Service at the Airport and no apologies whatsoever. The immigration staff did their very best to speed up the process and all 24 Counters were open. Just way way to many people arriving at the same time. 15.10.2014 EK60 HAM-DXB on B777 and continuing on EK306 DXB-PEK A380. Chauffeur service to HAM excellent new Mercedes S-Class all the comfort you need before a 16h Trip to Beijing. Lounge at HAM okay - lots of good quality food and drink quiet and very large thus not crowded even though flight was fully booked in Business Class. Aircraft was very new (April 2014) but 5 Row Business Class is just unacceptable. No real storage. Agree with most users that Seat is much too narrow and doesn't go fully flat (opposed to A380) I am a smaller person and the seat would not really fit in any position. Food was okay. Good but grumpy stewardess serving my seat. Overall a typical flight on a fully packed plane. DXB is a very nice airport (even at night) but very crowded. Business Lounge in T3A is good but very slow and spotty WiFi. Boarding directly to A380 Upper Deck is a nice touch but also clearly a necessity because of the crowds and cramped waiting areas for Y guests on the main floor. Flight DXB-PEK was comfortable had a good sleep - service was uneventful. Business Class was about 70% Full. On Board Entertainment again the best I have seen yet. The rest about Emirates has been explained on a platitude of occasions here.,8,28th October 2014,Germany
1938,I took the flight from Shanghai Pudong(PVG)-Dubai(DXB)-Hamburg(HAM) and FRA-DXB-PVG.The seats of A380 is comfortable and the food is nice. The air hosts and hostesses were very helpful. Shopping at Dubai Int'l Airport was so convenient because they received Euro and US Dollar. But the 18 hrs trip is a little tired!,7,28th October 2014,China
1939,Arrived at Dubai DBX at 18.15 for 21.45 on 10/10/14 flight to Perth to be told flight was over booked we had been travelling through Europe for eight weeks and had a stop over in Dubai. I was very surprised to hear we had no seats having booked the flight nearly 12 months in advance. We only managed to secure seats after we explained our daughter was flying overseas on the 11/10/14 and we would not see her for 3 months. We have travelled with Emirates several times because of the quick connecting flights to Europe but intend to look at other airlines operating from that area in future. We were very disappointed they way we were treated by Emirates on the last leg of our journey home it was the only blemish of our holiday.,8,22nd October 2014,Australia
1940,EK412 SYD-AKL 08.45 7 October 2014. A380-800. Very comfortable and extremely on time. The inflight entertainment was good so you don't care about anything else. Time went really fast because you are comfortable.,8,22nd October 2014,New Zealand
1941,EK0010 LGW-DXB. My experience with my recent Trip to Dubai to celebrate my 50th birthday travelling with Emirates was great and I have since recommended the airline to all my friends and family. The service and staff were excellent from start to finish.,7,22nd October 2014,United Kingdom
1942,Flew LGW-DXB-MEL-AKL in First on 23 September 777/A380. The First class experience exceeded my expectations. On all three sectors cabin crew were efficient and friendly with immediate responses to any service request. Chauffeur service worked exactly as booked. All lounges offered high standards of seating and refreshments. A la carte menu on all sectors offered meals to a very high restaurant standard. Shower facility on A380 well managed and co-ordinated and welcome towards the end of a 14 hour sector.,3,22nd October 2014,United Kingdom
1943,Flew AKL-SYD-DXB-LGW in First on 12 October. On the outward journey all crews on the three sectors were highly professional motivated and friendly with good banter ensuing throughout the flights. All flights on time with baggage first off the belt. Again chauffeur drive slotted in exactly as planned. An enjoyable trip.,10,22nd October 2014,United Kingdom
1944,"CMB-DXB: EK655: A330-200 Oct 12: Business Class. Plane immaculate for its age (1999-2000). However horribly let down by the most uncomfortable Business Class seats I've ever experienced over the past 17 years. Seven across in Business Class instead of six in an A330 is a rip-off. These seats are nothing like the nice new modular units in their B777-300ER aircraft. The video remote control intrudes into the 18"" wide seats making them clamp-like seats. Not suitable for the 4.5 hour flight. Service was very good and the food and beverages were good too. There were only five passengers that day in Business Class on this flight and I had the single row area behind First Class to myself. The tray table is too low when the seat is even slightly reclined. These are old cradle seats not flatbeds. The whole experience was let down by these awful seats the main reason one buys Business Class in the first place to get more personal space not something worse-than Economy Plus. Check-in and the dedicated Emirates Lounge at the BIA in CMB were excellent. On time performance and good baggage transfer to my connecting BA flight. EK is generally good but not their A330-200 seats.",4,22nd October 2014,United States
1945,I usually fly to Europe in economy class with Singapore Airlines via Singapore or Thai Airways via Bangkok but was persuaded to try Emirates. I found the 14.5 hours from Sydney to Dubai to be unbearable. The service from flight staff was both difficult to access and disinterested. Staff on the second leg to Amsterdam were much more personable. The experience was so bad that I have paid almost $3800 to upgrade to Business Class for the return journey. It had better be worth it!,5,22nd October 2014,Australia
1946,Flown MNL-DXB-MNL Sept 20 on EK 337. I was amazed by the in-flight service. Five drink runs on an 8 hour flight food is plenty and palatable. All the crew are hard-working attentive and friendly. And of course it's infamous inflight entertainment system ICE not to be failed to be mentioned. Looking forward for my next flight with them.,7,22nd October 2014,Philippines
1947,LAX to Hyderabad Economy October 102014 I always use Singapore Airlines and I decided to try Emirates for a change. Long story short: Singapore Airlines wins. Pros - the seating is comfortable great selection on entertainment nice mood lighting nice warm facial towels are provided to freshen up quick water service when requested. Cons - Food I ordered a Asian vegetarian meal 2 weeks in advance. It is actually offered as a part of the regular choice of 3 main course meals but it ran out before it got to my seat. This happened on the Dubai to Hyderabad flight which was for 3.5 hours. On the other flight I lucked out getting the last vegetarian meal. The main food meal service (lunch or dinner) is pretty filling. I felt Emirates should have reserved Asian vegetarian meals for those who pre-order and offer extra ones for the rest of the passengers during the service. A vegetarian pizza was given as a light snack in between - very salty. Dubai airport is poor when I compare it to Changi in Singapore. I was given a meal voucher at the ticketing desk. If you have a layover for over 4 hours you can get a free meal at Dubai airport. Also the free internet stations are horrible. The internet is slow and the machines cannot seem to load Internet explorer. I gave up after 5 mins of trying. Not worth using the Wifi there either. Dubai airport ever heard of high speed internet? Be prepared for the most unfriendly airport staff you will ever come across. No smile angry replies. Have a good flight if you are considering this airline.,7,22nd October 2014,United States
1948,6 Aug Gatwick-Dubai EK0010. 11 Aug Dubai - Singapore EK 0352. Sep 8 Singapore-Heathrow EK0005. London-Dubai service was appalling. Dinner was served after midnight although the flight took off at 8.15pm by then I was desperate for water which the crew kept saying they would serve with dinner. They ran out of choices on their menu and could only serve chicken. We were not served any breakfast nor a beverage before landing. However the flight from Dubai-Singapore was better than the one from Heathrow to Singapore. I won't take this flight unless it is the only airline that'll take me to the destination.,9,20th October 2014,United Kingdom
1949,After not having flown on Emirates in almost 7 years I recently flew EK round trip NYC/JFK to Milan/MXP. Departed on Thu 2nd Oct and returned Wed 8th Oct. Friendly service on both flights. Smiling and smartly turned out flight attendants on both flights always seen in the cabins. On the outbound flight - flying time of 7 hours 5 minutes 2 hot meals served. In between the meals 2 beverage services were provided. I like many other passengers skipped the hot breakfast in favor of more sleep time. On my return flight with flying time of 8 hours and 40 minutes a copious hot lunch was followed by an offering of fresh fruits and snack bars from wicker baskets. This was followed by a hot pizza snack and then about an hour prior to landing the same wicker baskets with fruits snack bars and pre-wrapped vegetarian sandwiches were offered. All of this in economy class! What more do passengers want?,1,20th October 2014,United States
1950,DMM-DXB-LAX return trip on Sept 18 and Oct 6 2014. I am a frequent traveller on this route at least 3 times a year and always with Emirates. After so many years of loyalty I am now tempted to try other airlines for the following reasons: Menu does not change on this route and it gets so unexciting and predictable after so many flights. While quantity of food is generous the taste is so below average. I have never seen sea-food being offered on this menu it is always the predictable steak Indian dish and Arabic dish. On board service consistency is very patchy sometimes I am lucky to be served by kind and helpful flight attendant in 50% of the flights I had not. Simple things such as smile when attending the customer never miss any customer when laying down mattress on long haul flight will be appreciated. While other aspects such as on-time arrival IFE lounge access complimentary limousine pick up at LAX are fine the on-board menu needs to be improved to retain customer loyalty. Considering that Emirates are charging premium and much more expensive that competitors I see no reason why it cannot improve on the menu and consistency of on-board service. Loyal customers such as myself are now shopping around for better experience and value than what Emirates is offering at the moment on the route. With less generous miles and redeeming a ticket now will cost close to 1000 dollars in additional fees and charges there has been something Emirates truly learned from its partner Qantas in how to upset its loyal customers by slapping them with 4 digit charges. Come on Emirates you used to wow me but not anymore.,5,20th October 2014,Saudi Arabia
1951,EK147 Y 22 Sep Dubai to Amsterdam. First time with Emirates on their A380 crew friendly on boarding. Seating was comfortable with excellent inflight entertainment system. Was served a light breakfast after departure which was tasty. We were situated reasonably close to the galley on this flight and I can't but help feel this particular crew may have been in training under the eyes of a supervisor with exacting standards. The inflight service food and beverage service was great not too much but not too little. Inflight announcements were clear. Lunch menu had a good choice and again was very tasty as was the free flowing wine service which I personally enjoyed.,10,20th October 2014,New Zealand
1952,I flew NCL-DEL-NCL. The flight was good. I ordered a special meal and this was provided. The flight attendants were very receptive and helpful. The entertainment system was one of the best I've used. It had a very wide variety to offer. The seats were neat clean and comfortable. Will definitely fly again.,5,13th October 2014,India
1953,ICN-DXB and DXB-LIS between October 5/6 on economy. Check-in was smooth and simple at ICN. Departed about 10 minutes late but arrived about 20 minutes early. Staff ranged from nice to snippy. Food was good with multiple drinks services in between meals. Noodles were available between meals but didn't see anyone having them. Entertainment system on A380 was state-of-the-art and worked perfectly with countless movies TV shows and albums to pick from. Wi-fi was free on that flight thanks to Eid and worked flawlessly on phone and tablet. Seats comfortable and roomy. Arrival and transfer in DXB was normal. DXB-LIS had an older B777 which is not as good but my window seat was on the back which has a 2-4-2 configuration. Recommend getting a seat on that section as you have more aisle space. Food was better than on the other flight with multiple drinks services in between meals again. Entertainment system is the same but the touch screen wasn't as responsive and software was slightly slower due to age of plane. Staff was nicer and didn't mind engaging in chit-chat with passengers. Departed 15 minutes late but arrived 30 minutes early. Overall very nice flights and airline.,9,13th October 2014,Portugal
1954,My flight was a true class act. Flew First Class DFW-DXB and it was better than expected. The crew were friendly and personable aiming to please throughout the flight. From the Dom Perignon champagne to onboard shower onboard lounge at the back of business class to the limo ride to my hotel in Dubai it was a flight to remember. This was my first time flying Emirates and after reading some of the mixed reviews here I have to say my experience surpassed all my expectations. For the benefit of readers I have flown a lot being a Lufthansa Hon (highest tier status) for the past 6 years. My opinion is the European carriers have a lot of catching up to do if they are to retain their share of premium passengers especially from the USA where Emirates is rapidly expanding.,9,12th October 2014,United States
1955,We were really looking forward to our A380 Melbourne to Auckland and return trip on a top airline. Although the plane was clean and comfortable. There were problems with staff and service. Our flight over was a 7am departure yet after the initial delivery of hot towels staff were absent unless called for nearly 2 hours not even to offer of water! Breakfast when it finally arrived was tasty although beverages came much later than the food. The same thing happened on the flight back a 6.30 pm departure with no food or drink until 8.15. On a nearly 4 hour flight drinks should be much more freely available. The entertainment system was more than fine but why interrupt everyone's viewing to tell us to watch it?,3,12th October 2014,Australia
1956,HKG-DXB-VIE and the same in return using A340 B777 and A380 aircraft. Three out of four sectors were fine: Excellent service and very clean and quiet aircraft. Big disappointment was in Business Class on the A380 due to one main factor: the fact that there is a fully serviced lounge bar area at the rear of Business Class. This sounds rather special until we realised that loud mouthed yobbos can stay in there for the entire journey (in this case Dubai to Hong Kong) and walking up and down the aisles with their drinks and abusing staff for not being fed lunch on time (even though they were all in the bar) and so on. I had to move further to the front of the aircraft to avoid the noise coming from this bar lounge area. This made for a very unpleasant experience and I could understand why some staff were very sad and quiet in going about their duties. Perhaps Emirates should seriously consider getting rid of this little so-called luxury as the concept seems to have backfired badly. The A380 flight was otherwise remarkably smooth partly due I suspect to the design of the aircraft but also the route take for this sector. Food and service on the remaining flights was superb but I could not recommend Business Class on the A380 for the problem of the bar-lounge section.,6,12th October 2014,Australia
1957,Bangkok to Dubai and then on to BHX. A very pleasant trip on both legs of the Journey. The only gripe I have was the seven hour wait in Dubai but that was my fault for booking that flight. The flight crew were great the food was great and the ICE entertainment was world class. The return trip BHX to Dubai and Bangkok was great. No complaints from me except one (when food was served the crew did not ask the people to put their seat back to the upright position). Other than that I can say that Emirates are a very good Airline to fly with and I would have no hesitation in flying with them again in the future.,3,12th October 2014,Thailand
1958,Long time Emirates business class passenger - Australia to UK and or Europe. Flights and services are deteriorating and we will look to another airline after recent trips in September. Flight from Melbourne to Dubai was given a gate at Cargo terminal in Dubai resulting in long delays in off loading passengers and luggage and our luggage (plus the other passenger's) then missed our next flight to Zurich. Staff not good on flight. Dubai to Zurich staff were better. Returning found no Emirates business lounge at Amsterdam - desk staff embarrassed and unhelpful. Gate slow to open and not enough seating - area of terminal where Emirates is located has almost no services. Amsterdam to Dubai staff were helpful and so were Dubai to Melbourne staff. Luggage came out late.,9,12th October 2014,Australia
1959,Jakarta (JKT) to Dubai DBX - the seats are very narrow and uncomfortable for a Business class. The food was outstanding but the airplane was dirty. When you fly for business you require a good rest on the aircraft and you expect a comfortable seat.,1,12th October 2014,Venezuela
1960,Just flew return BNE to DXB on A380 and then onto VCE on a B777. I agree with what many on here have said. If your flight is on an A380 then it will be excellent plenty of space plenty of food and drinks toilets clean and spacious. If you are on on B777 not so good - cramped seat configuration staff overworked felt not much different to a budget carrier. If it were a long haul flight I would consider another airline.,9,12th October 2014,Australia
1961,"Flew on the EK 38 on September from Birmingham to Dubai. First time flight on Emirates very disappointed! Expected great things long wait for bar service told not long after two hours food arrived no drinks. Asked cabin crew ""it's a short flight"" we are not serving drinks until later. Really not what we were expecting. Biggest problem was the very poor attitude of crew. Complaints department said drink fountains are provided.",10,12th October 2014,United Kingdom
1962,Having flown First or Business class long-haul from east-coast Australia to north Africa the Middle-East and Spain three times as well as trans-Pacific to North America twice in 11 months I consider I am well qualified to say that both Emirates' First and Business on their A380s simply don't cut it. From the time my wife and I checked in at Brisbane there was simply nothing to make us feel special. plane seating is okay but no better than Etihad and the onboard shower more a time-filling novelty. A flight is not just the time on board. The lounge in Brisbane is dull and sparse and as it is shared with at least 84 traveling Business plus whatever FF card-holders are in economy not surprisingly very crowded and noisy. There is nothing to make the $23000 expended on First Class deliver any kind of special or exclusive feel. Onboard the outbound leg the cabin crew were obviously tired and disinterested. To land in Dubai and have to be off-loaded via stairs in the desert-heat and put on a bus for a 15 minute 5 kilometre lap of the on-going massive airport expansion project only to have to then walk scurry elevator and shuttle-pod back to almost where we started taking over an hour from landing to lounge. Lucky we're fit and speedy as it is a physical challenge after the 15 hours on board. The cabin crew on to Barcelona was a complete contrast to the tired Brisbane-Dubai crew with attentive service. Arrival in Spain was slick and via an air bridge. Departure however was a different story with the crowded lounge and nothing to eat except ham sandwiches crisps and a platter of limp stale pastries. The crew and onboard service were fine and the airbridge arrival in Dubai on time. The return Dubai to Brisbane was the final straw that at this stage has turned me off Emirates possibly forever. The chauffeur failed to arrive at our hotel. On arrival at the First check-in nobody could care less about out the chauffeur not showing up. First check-in promptly spat out the boarding passes and told us to get moving as it was a 20 minute walk to the gate. We managed to find a small First lounge just past the gate and had time for a quick refres. At gate 23 there was no separate priority boarding for First or Business passengers. All 520 passengers were jostling and pushing to get through one small door. Emirates boarding was farcical and sums up what Emirates have become. Once onboard staff did their jobs providing good attention all the way to Brisbane. First offers cabin service pretty much on demand however one thing I have never noticed previously in First was the constant clattering of cutlery and crockery. There are no socks at all and earplugs have to be requested. We also found the cabin hot and noisy and despite repeated requests by us and other passengers in First it remained uncomfortably hot. In conclusion I won't choose Emirates again.,8,8th October 2014,Australia
1963,I neither would fly Emirates again nor recommend them. They position themselves as a high end service but are actually low cost/low service. We just flew Rome to Sydney via Dubai and Bangkok. The Dubai to Sydney sector was an old 777 with 10 abreast seating (3-4-3). The 777 was designed for 9 abreast seating but EK has added an extra seat in the middle. The cabin is like a sardine can. The service was amateur. The entertainment system average. A horrid flight and experience. EK positions itself against Singapore Cathay Qantas and the like. However it really is a third rate airline. Never again.,9,8th October 2014,Australia
1964,"Emirates service has down downhill over the last few years. Recently flew Melbourne to Dubai and return. A380 both ways. Check in staff very disinterested. Plane was extremely hot. I rang for some water - no one came. The second time I went to the galley and asked for a drink. Staff just gave me a drink and walked off. Passengers recline their seats during meal times which makes life very difficult. Food was appalling on flight over and back - stale bread rolls even warmed up croissants tasted stale. Dubai check in staff even worse than Melbourne for return flight. The woman went to put wrong labels on my luggage. When I pointed this out she said ""Well there are two flights to Melbourne"" - I would have thought that was her job to check not mine. Very hard to get a drink on flight going home. Snacks were handed out in the night but our row missed out. A man sitting behind me asked for some nuts and was told ""There are no nuts for economy passengers"". Sought of sums up the whole attitude.",5,8th October 2014,Australia
1965,2 Oct Glasgow-Dubai 777-300ER. Check in smooth and easy at Glasgow. Flight was nearly an hour late taking off which made our connection tight in Dubai. Can't fault the staff or service on board although the food wasn't great. Sat at the back of the plane in one of the few rows of two seats. Dubai-Hong Kong A380 - wider seats and much smoother ride. Again food quite bland but all crew were friendly and cheerful. Switched seats at check in to an empty row towards the back and luckily had all three seats to ourselves so very comfortable journey.,3,8th October 2014,United Kingdom
1966,CGK-AMS (via DXB) and AMS-CGK (via DXB). The staff were rude. Act like robots. lack of honesty sincerity and hospitality. Great entertainment.,5,5th October 2014,Indonesia
1967,I have flown Emirates pretty much all my life. Emirates considers itself one of the best airlines - I think this is true only sometimes. For the most part I see the service (on certain routes) getting worse with time. By service I mean that of the cabin crew. They do not seem to like their jobs at all and don't like dealing with passengers. I agree it's not nice dealing with certain passengers who don't co-operate but why treat everyone the same way? And why must we hear what the cabin crew have to say about the unruly passengers? With some other routes I still do see very friendly cabin crew from time to time but it's rare now. Entertainment is pretty good on some flights but some routes it's terrible almost non-existent. I do like the food though. The flights would be so much better if the cabin crew seem less - angry impatient and grumpy. You almost feel like a criminal when you request something!,3,5th October 2014,United Arab Emirates
1968,Flew to Mauritius via Dubai and chose Emirates because of good recommendation. Not impressed. Only good thing to say is that there is plenty of leg room. Crew were uninterested in service and in one case downright rude. Food largely inedible. The breakfast was particularly horrible. My husband had an aisle seat and every time someone went past he was bumped. Would like to know why when we were due to land at 7am we were woken at 4 am. Breakfast arrived at 4.45 and then the lights were put out again. Obviously for the convenience of the crew and not the passengers who appear to be an annoyance.,1,1st October 2014,United Kingdom
1969,Caught the A380 from Rome to Dubai Sept 17th. Plane was lovely clean plenty of room. Took awhile to board at Rome airport and everyone seemed to want to push on. Staff seemed to lack control of boarding process. We still took off on time though. Food was excellent tasty and lots of it. Drinks were abundant although not cold was offered ice though. Toilets clean. Seats roomy. Seemed a lot of people bringing on a lot of cabin luggage! Staff seemed unconcerned with this. Some children behind me were not being controlled by parents which worried me at first but staff very professionally kept them monitored!,10,1st October 2014,Australia
1970,Got the A380 from Dubai to Heathrow EK001. Loved the plane. Very new looking and swish! Toilets updated and cleaned regularly seats roomy and I am a big lady! Entertainment was great. Staff were a little harassed thought they were maybe understaffed as very different from earlier connecting flight. They still managed to get all the food delivered and drink runs done! Boarding was easy in Dubai despite this being or first venture outside of English speaking countries. Felt a little less special than at Adelaide but then that would be because in Adelaide we were the special ones at Dubai we were one of many! Plane was very quiet compared to the 777 a bit more clumsy on take off and landing though! I think this is more plane design issue. Food was outstanding. Very tasty and a lot of it!,5,1st October 2014,Australia
1971,First Long Haul flight to Dubai from Adelaide EK441 300-777. Found boarding at Adelaide International very professional and easy! Seats were at back of plane. My choice however we picked seats that had immovable solid sides and as I was larger it made it a bit squashed however I was glad of the extra aisle room as the 3 seater areas looked very small and often the passengers seemed to get bumped a lot! Toilets were clean until the end of the trip where they were over used and left messy the food was great. Very tasty and a lot of it. Left feeling full! Cold drinks were warm and hot drinks were cold. Service was great though. Staff seemed very friendly. The comfort bags were good and we used the eye pads and blankets. Ambience of the plane for time zones was good. Entertainment kept me entertained!,9,1st October 2014,Australia
1972,This is the first time that I have flown with Emirates and if I can avoid it I will never fly with them again. The service was terrible - the meal was served and half an hour later they came to ask if we wanted beverages with our dinner. Bit late as most people had already finished. The leg room was not adequate for an average person and the staff were very indifferent to the passengers. In Dubai it was more important that the girls behind the desk send text messages than attend to customers. We actually had to ask them to help us even though there were two people behind the desk and no one except us waiting. So much for customer service. I can't think of anything positive about the experience. By comparison Qantas for the second leg to Sydney was a dream with attentive staff beverages offered at the same time as meals. Snacks bought around every hour as well as water and other beverages offered every hour. The toilets were clean and tidy and the staff were super friendly. Could not fault their service.,8,1st October 2014,Australia
1973,Emirates Flight 406 from Dubai to Melbourne 22 SEP. The limousine failed to pick us up at our hotel which had been arranged the previous day. There were no ground staff to show us the way to the lounge/gate. On board I found the staff less than friendly. I expect to receive prompt attention when I request water to be replaced and food to be delivered during the breakfast service. My past experience has been satisfactory the steward aboard our Nice to Dubai flight on 20 SEP made sure we knew the aircraft features and helped with our carry-on bag at the bottom of the stairs on our arrival in Dubai. The state of the Business washroom on 22 SEP was unsatisfactory. I followed a staff member who had just used the washroom and found the litter container full and overflowing toilet paper on the floor and the toilet bowl very dirty. I have been a frequent traveller with Emirates but will consider another airline in the future.,9,1st October 2014,Australia
1974,Caught the Dubai to Adelaide 300-777 Sept 18 2014. After the A380 experience this was definitely a louder bumpier ride! Seats were smaller and more cramped. People had far to much cabin baggage which really annoyed me on this flight as it was us who had stuck to the rules of 7kg limit 1 bag who had to separate our luggage and have it stashed all over the plane. I feel this should be policed by the terminal staff. Our luggage was only ever weighed leaving Adelaide airport. The people in front reclined their seats fully for the whole trip and they were not asked to sit upright when we were trying to eat which had happened on other recent flights. The galley was very noisy especially in down time when the passengers where trying to sleep. The toilets were very noisy when flushed and although we were seated away from the toilet we still constantly got woken by them. Ambience was lovely. Plane was clean and fresh looking although a little worn around the edges. Food was tasty and a lot of it. Drinks were regular but cold drinks were warm. Seemed a common problem on all our flights. Staff were friendly and attentive just loud. My entertainment screen was broken and wouldn't work by touch once I worked out the hand set this was ok. The audio was broken and static I had to listen to one ear input only! This was a shame as the other experiences I had were great and despite this I would still fly Emirates and recommend them to friends.,10,1st October 2014,Australia
1975,We flew last night from Athens to Dubai and Dubai to Singapore and both flights were horrible. Firstly our flight from Athens to Dubai was on a 777 the seats were that out that the back supports for both myself and my partner were broken and stuck out for the whole flight of 4 hours. Secondly we flew from Dubai to Singapore and for the whole 7.5 hrs flight the entertainment system did not work for me and my partner - it's very poor service and after my last flight tonight from Singapore to Sydney I will no longer fly again with Emirates.,5,28th September 2014,Australia
1976,EK432 Dubai to Brisbane via Singapore (Continuation after EK2 - see separate post). Economy B777-300ER. Disembarking from EK2 all transfer pax clear a security check before entering the terminal eliminating the need for it at the gate. Clear signage to the next gate. Not impressed with T3B terminal. Boarding was just turn up and go. No order. Once onboard the difference between the A380 and B777 is quiet marked. Seats an inch smaller and the aisles are smaller too. I had an aisle seat and every time the trolley or a person went by I was bumped. The person next to me was a little above average and kept leaning into my seat when she fell asleep. It was most uncomfortable not helped by the AV units under the seat taking up space. The food offerings on the first 7 hours sector was too light. A roll and breakfast of cheese omelette. No sausage bacon or baked beans. The last dinner I had was a bit bland a beef casserole. Would have benefited from a wine reduction. The AV on this craft was the old ICE. Far more limited and a smaller very blurry screen. Very difficult to get it to load were you wanted. We had a medical emergency and had to make a landing in India. We were told it would take 30 mins but it added 2 hours to our trip arriving at 2.30 BNE time. At no point did the crew tell us what time we were expected to arrive in BNE. I had to spend my time in Singapore looking on the web to find out and make arrangements. Very poor form. This along with the incredibly uncomfortable seats on the 777 make it extremely unlikely I will fly with Emirates again if this is the only option available.,6,24th September 2014,United Kingdom
1977,"Perth - Dubai - Stockholm then Heathrow - Dubai - Perth. On a Qantas ticket but code shared with Emirates. Emirates Business Class consistently high standard. Personal greetings and introductions nothing too much trouble. Food and beverages excellent. Lounges excellent especially in Perth. Emirates Business seats are slightly narrow for sleeping but overall good. Contrast with Qantas is very stark - Heathrow - Dubai was with QF with other 3 legs with Emirates. QF not quite ""sit down shut up and don't bother us"" - but that's what it felt like. The lesson is - get a QF ticket to get the points and status credits but fly on Emirates codeshare planes to get the service.",9,24th September 2014,Australia
1978,"EK402 London Heathrow to Dubai connecting to EK432 to Brisbane (See separate report) Economy Class A380. First ever flight with Emirates. Check in at LHR quick and efficient. Carry on bags were weighed and tagged at check in. Boarding by zones seem to make it quick but it did take a long time. Lots of people wanting to swap seats and a few claiming to be ill to get an upgrade or window seat. Selected bulkhead seat and had couple with baby next to me. Toilets in front and the full size door opened 180 if left and would hit me. People would step on my feet while waiting for the loo. Food was good but there was supposed to be a ""sweet treat"" served with the pre landing drinks. This didn't happen. Given this is about the same length as LHR-JFK BA and AA serve a proper snack. If we were meant to hold onto the ""Light Bites"" from the meal tray then it wasn't made clear. ICE+ was very good but the armrest for the bulk head seats was too low. 18"" seats felt comfortable. Staff very good. Overall a satisfactory flight for the distance flown.",4,24th September 2014,United Kingdom
1979,London to Dubai on 6/9 flight EK 012 and returned 12/9 flight EK 0009. I flew business class with Emirates both on 777 and 380 airbus. The seats were narrow in the extreme even on the 380 and I found it very uncomfortable. The staff were 'going through the motions' and the food was tepid. I have flown with many airlines-first time with Emirates. If you compare them to Qantas they have much to learn. Not impressed at all and will avoid in future.,5,22nd September 2014,United Kingdom
1980,I have flow with Emirates 6 times now and there are some very good good and poor aspects to the overall experience. In particular I refer to our Istanbul to Dubai flight on 7 Aug 2014. There was the normal long delay in check-in due in perceive (after working 30 years in aviation) large quantity of check in baggage that Emirates passengers have - some would see as a plus - combined with minimal experience staff. But the carry on baggage was the big issue both in regard to safety and comfort! Some people were bringing 35kg on board. Bags that just fitted into the lockers and a passenger opposite us had three of them. The onboard staff just helped them put more into the lockers without regard to the effect on others of the 100 passengers I could observe we were the only ones under the 7kg stated limit. When a senior crew from business class started stuffing our soft bags into a smaller space so they could get others large bags away and close the doors I was pointedly told what I could do with my concerns. He did not dispute that others had 35kg of carry on bags! In addition we had 2 obese passengers next to us. The crew provided them with extension seat belts but this doesn't stop them squashing those adjacent. Again the crew were unhelpful. I spent most of the flight walking around the aircraft. Finally the food on this flight was well below the standard I have known on other Emirates flights.,6,22nd September 2014,Australia
1981,I've flown Emirates over a period of ten years and I can comprehensively say that every time I fly the service is getting worse. Emirates pitch themselves as being a top-top airline and to a degree the service they offer on paper is quite comprehensive. Their route network is very good and their fares at times can be competitive however the last four long haul flights I've taken with Emirates progressively gets worse. The cabin staff seem disinterested in providing a first class service to the nonchalant ground staff in Dubai. They are cutting back massively on quality they've stopped handing out comfort packs for flights the food is getting worse and the cabin crew don't respond to calls made from your chair. I can give quite a few examples of bad service travelling with Emirates over the last few trips however it was compounded by a poor experience travelling with an infant recently. I've always looked forward to flying with Emirates and I have quite a few Tier Miles and Skywards miles however I feel I've flown my last flight with Emirates.,3,19th September 2014,New Zealand
1982,I flew SYD-BKK in Sep 2014. This was my first time flying Emirates though certainly not my first time flying. I've flown quite a few of the greats (ie Cathay Singapore Malaysian Qantas etc) but Emirates completely impressed me. I flew economy and the furnishings and ambience felt and looked better than most economy cabins I've been in. The service was fantastic. Friendly and fast. Not to mention the flight attendants were immaculately groomed well-presented and spoken and quite attractive (male and female). Their overall demeanour was professional friendly and classy. This is in stark contrast to other airlines (ahem Qantas) whose cabin crew look and act like they'd rather be elsewhere. The food was good and plentiful and the in-flight entertainment was excellent.,2,19th September 2014,Australia
1983,Flew Mumbai - Dubai on the Boeing 777-200 ER. Even though the flight arrived late into Mumbai I applaud the Emirates staff at Mumbai to do everything possible to keep the flight on-time and it was with a slight 5-10 min delay in departure. The aircraft had the ICE AVOD system. The first 30 mins of my flight wasn't satisfying as my PTV froze after take off and crew members did not help. It was only a seat change which actually made my experience on Emirates really worthwhile. I was glad to see the patience the Emirates cabin crew have in dealing with passengers. Crew were polite well-mannered and courteous. Food was great. However my seat seemed to be a little bit on the uncomfortable side but I guess for this short sector its pretty good.,1,19th September 2014,United Arab Emirates
1984,First time Business Class with EK. VIE-DXB-HKG.DXB-VIE. Disappointing service by cabin crew remote stand in DXB on the way out lounge in DXB very different in the Terminal areas. A380 nice but bar closing early and was partly not staffed while all cabin crew chatting in the back. Service the pure minimum for the travel class (small selection and medium quality) and inflexible. You did not see staff after main service. Woken up for breakfast just to wait half an hour for it and the last hour of the flight there was no service and bar closed. I could have slept longer this happened on both A380 flights. IFE is great good selection. Expectations where high as was the ticket price and EK did not deliver in my view.,2,19th September 2014,Austria
1985,My wife and I live in Singapore and consequently fly quite frequently to visit family/friends. Emirates have always been one of our top choice airlines for 7 years. It is therefore with sadness that I have to complain about the in-flight service received on flight EK37 on 10th July which was the beginning of a tour of the UK. We have always found the stewards very professional in their approach and care for passengers. However on this flight even before we were airborne personal and banal chit-chat from the staff was very audible from where we were sitting and remained so for the entirety of the flight. Throughout the flight the emergency exit behind us was blocked by the trolley and an ever-growing pile of cardboard rubbish which prevented us from standing to stretch our legs. Furthermore when we did stand it was made quite clear that we were in the way. During meal service the air stewardess commenced the service with my wife only to be shouted at that she had started at the wrong ‘end’. Consequently she left midway in serving my wife and proceeded to the other ‘end’. This has somewhat clouded our view of Emirates and we are reluctant given the price of a ticket these days to fly with this airline again.,8,17th September 2014,Singapore
1986,Just flown Emirates for the first time Manchester-Dubai-Singapore-Melbourne out Mel-KL-Dubai-Manchester return. All in Economy. 14th August to 14th September. I won't use them again. Apart from one leg a more miserable unenthusiastic group of attendants I have yet to see. Food on all of the sections was grim. ICE entertainment on way back awful. On three sections delays and not one explanation even after the First and Business clients complained after us poor souls in economy. I booked thinking I would get Qantas service how disappointed was I. Next time I fly from Manchester I shall use Etihad or Qatar or even go to LHR again. Very disappointed.,3,17th September 2014,United Kingdom
1987,We flew from London to Dubai on 9th September 2014 on the A380 with two children one infant and toddler. It was really great to fly with Emirates. The staff were very friendly good food and it exceeded our expectations. My only regret was not to use the same airline to fly back to London.,6,17th September 2014,United Kingdom
1988,We flew first class from Bangalore to LAX. Emirates has exceptional on the ground service with a punctual chauffeur drive service hassle free check in and security and great lounges. We flew the 777 to Dubai this particular one had Emirates older first class seat which was pretty good it was lie flat and had massage controls a great recline and excellent IFE. Service started with caviar and smoked salmon and we had wonderful steak. Service was good with constant drink refills and a great amenity kit. We landed at Dubai and then headed to the first class transfer desk and then were taken by golf buggies to the first class lounge . The lounge was exceptional with its own duty free area massage rooms private rooms daybeds al a carte fine ding a cigar room a wine cellar and individual buffets at the gates. The best part about this lounge was that we boarded the plane from the lounge. The next sector was on the A380 with private suites and a shower spa. We had champagne on the ground and browsed through their IFE selection. We took off and the wonderful meal service started with excellent food being served and us being the only first class passengers the flight was personalised. Crew were attentive always addressing us by name and telling us about themselves. There is a nice bar with a real bartender and great snacks. The lavatory was neat and the shower spa experience was great with all the shower essentials being provided. We were also given herbal teas and a plate of fruit after are shower which was a nice touch. There were multiple meals and snacks served which were good and the overall experience was great. Emirates first class service is truly unique.,1,17th September 2014,United States
1989,Rome to Sydney via Dubai. First time with Emirates courtesy of a QF code-share. Both flights on A380 aircraft. I enjoyed the opportunity to sit at the front of the lower deck as economy uses the entire deck. IFE is class- leading and food and drink (including a pre-dinner drink service) was great. Seat pitch was very good as were the crew. I would be very happy to fly Emirates again.,8,17th September 2014,Australia
1990,EK434 an A380 window seat towards the rear of the cabin. There was an initial delay of 3 hours as the first aircraft became unserviceable. This required all 472 passengers to disembark and relocate to Terminal A. Whilst the cabin crew did well with this unavoidable situation Emirates' ground crew did not handle this well as there was absolutely no guidance or assistance once we were in the terminal. All they needed to do was to advise us to proved to the transfer area re-clear security and take the shuttle to terminal A. They made no such announcement which resulted in some degree of chaos in the terminal building. However this was a relatively minor issue in the overall scheme. Once underway this proved to be the best long haul business class experience I have ever had. The crew were extremely attentive and friendly the catering was outstanding and the privacy afforded by the window seat was second to none. The cocktail bar at the rear of the cabin is a terrific bonus. The fully flat bed with light duvet afforded me the best in flight sleep I have had in many years. One note of caution: if you purchase duty free alcohol in DXB it will be taken from you at the boarding gate and securely stored on the aircraft as UAE law prevents passengers from taking it as carry-on luggage. You will then need to wait for it to be delivered at the point of arrival (in my case at the oversized luggage bet in BNE). This resulted in what would have been a 15 minute customs clearance taking over 40 minutes. The lesson learned: to avoid delays on arrival purchase duty free alcohol at the point of arrival not in DXB. Overall despite the minor inconvenience of the previous aircraft breakdown I cannot fault EK’s high quality service on this flight and highly recommend it for all long haul flights.,10,17th September 2014,Australia
1991,LHR-DXB-BKK / BKK-DXB-LHR. My first experience with Emirates and it was an impressive one. All flights on time with no issues with connecting flights. Outward connection at Dubai for 3 hours was a bit too long followed by another 6 hour flight to Bangkok would have meant feeling shattered on arrival but it was a brand new 777-300 and it was empty I counted 10 pax in our section so climbed on the 4 seats and slept uninterrupted until woken for landing. How anyone can not be impressed by the A380 beggars belief. We had seats in the rear on outward front section on return and it's incredibly quiet compared to the 747! Plenty of leg room (I'm 6ft) and comfortable seats. Food quality was good too I've flown Thai quite a few times and the food as been excellent every time for me Emirates was not far behind. Plenty of drink runs and flight attendants were helpful and courteous. The ICE system needs hardly any mention it's simply superb especially on the A380. Online check-in and seat selection made this experience an effortless one. We landed at LHR at a busy time early Friday evening we were off the aircraft through border control and collected our luggage within 50 minutes! All in all can't fault Emirates. Would recommend and certainly fly again.,8,17th September 2014,United Kingdom
1992,"I have travelled Emirates a lot but the last 2 experiences were not as anticipated. We flew from Gatwick to Johannesburg via Dubai on the 26th June 2014. Staff on flight to Dubai were good kids fed and good attention. Flight to Johannesburg was not so staff seemed occupied and unavailable. You had to keep asking for things like kids toys drinks etc which I do not really like doing. Return flight to the UK via Dubai on the 2nd of September was the worst of them all. Staff are different now to when we flew a year ago on the same route. Check in was a hassle in JNB and Dubai. Our 2 year old was not given a child's meal because ""it was not booked"" we had to keep asking for almost everything. Both kids were not given the complimentary toys. The cabin crew seem to have no people skils at all - only one seemed to be on top of his game. Previous staff 2011-2013 were always happy caring and service was impeccable. Standards have changed and I will be trying other airlines after such an experience. Emirates have to do something about their staff especially in terms of customer services and people skills. Travelling with kids is not easy and Emirates has been one of the airlines very good at easing this but this has changed. Cabin crew should not look like they are just doing their jobs but happy to be of assistance.",1,17th September 2014,United Kingdom
1993,Emirates have very clean and modern aircraft excellent entertainment and easy transfers to and from flights within Dubai. Unfortunately the cabin crew are not upholding the Emirates values which crew displayed 10 yrs ago. I was shocked at the decline of customer care once showed by crew in economy. I flew from MEL-DXB to Italy return crew were rude never smiled avoided pax told pax to wait for the next service upon drink requests and did everything to make for an unpleasant flight. Next time I will fly another carrier. Crew should treat every pax as they would want their family members treated and remember they have chosen to be there!,1,17th September 2014,Australia
1994,SYD-AKLO-SYD September 2014 Return trip on the A380. Both flights about half full. Food good particularly on return leg and staff were welcoming. They were happy to provide passengers with additional drinks beyond the trolley service with dinner on the return leg. Entertainment fantastic and undoubtedly the best (had flown on Etihad in business the week before and struggled to find things to watch). Flight back to Sydney was 25 minutes early. If they were like this on all their flights then they would deserve a 5 star rating.,6,14th September 2014,United Kingdom
1995,Flew MAN-DXB 26 Aug. Ordered Bassinet seat due to 1 under 2. Flew with 2 young children. Given this disappointed at activity pack. Staff rushed and whilst not rude seem stretched tired and not always helpful (huge contrast with our return via Qatar Airways). Considering this is emirates was a distinctly average flight. Satisfactory.,1,14th September 2014,United Kingdom
1996,Travelled London to Dubai. Aircraft in excellent condition didn't feel the plane rattle during take off and the landing was perfect. Arrived at destination on time picked up luggage and was out of the terminal 15 min later. Great selection of onboard entertainment that I ended up watching 3 movies throughout flight. Nothing extraordinary with food but as flight was not a long haul it was enough to get by. What I felt was the deal breaker was the rudeness of FAs who didn't give a toss about customer service. A request for water didn't come until a quarter of an hour and only after another reminder met by a glare. When it did the FA (another one) poured too much and spilt some on me but she was in a rush to push her trolley to even say a word of apology. The FAs in my cabin section were hardly smiling and didn't make efforts to put their passengers at ease. Why were they so grumpy and ill mannered?,1,14th September 2014,United Kingdom
1997,We have been flying for Emirates for four years and the service is still amazing. My last flight was DXB-MNL in Business Class. It was a log-haul flight 9.05 hours. This was the first time I've experienced Business Class and it was superb! The seats were lie-flat the crew were (very) friendly and tried to keep you well-fed the IFE System is still excellent and the Lounge was very good. Definitely going to fly with Emirates again.,8,14th September 2014,Philippines
1998,We flew economy from Paris to Sydney via Dubai. It was my first time flying with Emirates so I was unsure what to expect. Everything was great! Great seats which recline enough to relax in economy. Enough TV shows and movies which kept me entertained and for my wife who prefers things in Arabic there was also subtitles on mostly everything for her. What we did do to make things a little easier was the first leg Paris to Dubai I purposely selected a flight with the 13 hour layover so we left France in the morning arrived Dubai around 8pm. Explored the shops visited the spa for a massage then stayed in the Airport Hotel over night for our connecting flight the next morning. It was the first time I had done it this way normally just allowing 2-3 hours wait between flights but then usually you are so tired on that second flight you sleep and in economy its not the most comfortable which ever airline you choose as you are not in a lie flat bed. So did that and left the follow morning for Dubai to Sydney. This was a long flight though entertainment system is fantastic. The food for me was nice though my wife did not like any of the hot food. All in all it was a great flight and I will fly with Emirates again.,8,9th September 2014,Australia
1999,August 11-12 flight EK127 and EK335. The crew gets sloppier and sloppier! We've flown MNL-DXB-VIE and the crew seemed to react more to a Pax with two Infants rather than one? We didn't get anything for my Infant and the other seat got something? They didn't even ask how old my infant was. All in all I think the service was not as good as always. The crew from DXB-VIE was very slow and seemed so busy that you didn't want to request anything.,3,9th September 2014,Austria
2000,Flew London to Bangkok via Dubai. London to Dubai was reasonable no complaints. Other than I had the only seat with the inflight entertainment not working. However the service staff reset this and it began to work. Good choice of films. The entertainment also includes sport TV shows latest movies movie classics and music. The food was good - I had salmon for starter with a yoghurt chicken and sticky toffee pudding. The best flight food I have had. The breakfast wasn't bad either. The seats weren't too good though - slight lack of legroom. Dubai to Bangkok started slightly late but made up the time. Nice choice of newspapers and magazines for in flight use as well. Food on this leg not so good but still reasonable. I had a fish curry which was quite edible. I cant really comment on value for money as I paid for my ticket as a RTW flight so I didn't know the cost of this ticket.,2,9th September 2014,United Kingdom
2001,LAX-DXB on business class. Cabin crew were extremely unfriendly. I've been a gold member on Emirates for the last 3 years and recently I'm more and more disappointed with the quality of service and the value for money.,3,6th September 2014,United Arab Emirates
2002,Flew from BHX to Hong Kong (via Dubai and Bangkok) in August 2014. Now after 15 odd long haul flights on Emirates over the last 4 years I can safely say they are not as good as they used to be. The tired old 777 from BHX to DXB was awful the entertainment didn't work the crew were grumpy and the food was tasteless. I must say the A380 from DXB to Hong Kong was a vast improvement apart from the crew. I appreciate some passengers can be tricky to control when they stand up during taxing and landing etc but other passengers should not be able to hear attendants be very rude about them to their colleagues.,10,6th September 2014,United Kingdom
2003,DXB-ADL. My wife received an email from Emirates about upgrading what a great choice to do so. We had seats 10 DE. This was our first time in International BC and what an experience from the time we were dropped at DXB terminal 3 business class check-in throughout the flight and disembarking a fantastic way to end our holiday. International BC with Emirates from now on.,9,6th September 2014,Australia
2004,ADL-DXB-LHR. My first time flying with Emirates and enjoyed the journey Boeing 777ER. Check-in was quick and efficient as was the boarding. We were seated in row 19 AB for the flight to DXB. Nice and comfortable seating the in flight entertainment is excellent as was the food and service. We arrived in DXB on time and had a 2 hour layover before our flight onto LHR. The LHR leg was on the A380 in row 43AB. Once again boarding for us was quick and efficient the flight was smooth and the cabin service very good along with the food and beverage. Arrived in LHR on time but would have been earlier as we were held up by ATC. A great experience with Emirates and will definitely fly again.,2,6th September 2014,Australia
2005,MXP-DXB. This was the first leg of our returning home. Once again check-in was quick and efficient as well as boarding. We were sitting in row 19 AB and had no issues. The cabin staff were friendly and efficient and the food very good. We arrived into DXB on time and then transported to by bus to the arrivals area. Overall and once again a great experience flying with Emirates.,1,6th September 2014,Australia
2006,Monday 25th August 2014 EK 776. DUR to DXB have been Skywards Gold for many years always had good to excellent service on Emirates. This flight however was one of the worst. Food service has always been prompt after takeoff to allow pax to sleep and breakfast left to the last minute. 2 hours after takeoff and food was served many pax asking for main or asking for table cloth etc. to be removed. Throughout the night there was constant noise from the galley banging of plates crew talking loudly leaving curtain open (I closed it 3 times). Breakfast served 2.5 hours before landing so total sleep time was about 3 hours (normally I get 5 to 6 on this flight). Friend in economy said no breakfast was served and every time he asked for a drink it never came. Hope this is not a sign of things to come.,3,6th September 2014,United Arab Emirates
2007,I fly Emirates as often as I can and if they had a route from Heathrow to JFK no one would fly either BA or Virgin to NY. This week I flew BA to Dubai for business and Emirates back (only because it was last minute and Emirates was full on the way to Dubai). I flew business class and was upgraded to First just as I was walking on board the plane. It was a complete surprise but they really look after both their silver and the gold card members very well. BA does nothing of the sort. The plane was clean the food superb the staff lovely. It honestly is one of the best experiences in flying on earth and they have really got their product right. It puts their competition to shame. Well done Emirates!,10,6th September 2014,United Kingdom
2008,BKK-DXB-KWT Been upgraded in First excellent at every level. Service was spotless food was great and wine was fantastic. Always amazed by this airline. My return to BKK was in Biz really good on A380 had a great sleep.,8,1st September 2014,Thailand
2009,DXB-AMS in a 777-300er. Booked a economy ticket full fare one day in advance. Received a upgrade to business class when ariving at airport. Great seats staff and diner although Inflight Entertainment felt a little bit worn out in this 777 (A380 had a better system) nice flight and on time!,10,1st September 2014,Netherlands
2010,Flew ADL-DXB-BHX return on 777 all the way. Seats felt smaller (not sure if they are) and the service was below average. I had to ask numerous times for a drink on the long let the seat belt signs were on for 8 hours so I could not help myself to water but they did not bring trays of water/juice around regularly either. Everything seemed to be too much trouble. On the return leg from BHX-DXB the flight was not full and many women with children moved away from their sleeping husbands to sit next to other customers who were probably hoping to curl up on the extra seat. They allowed their children to claw the hair of passengers in front and change channels of those behind. They were not asked to return to their seats and one even changed a nappy on the seat and at no time was approached by cabin crew. The food was fairly awful and I was forgotten for over an hour when they ran out of my choice (though I was happy to have anything). It wasn't cheap $2400 AUD return but they are direct from Adelaide.,9,1st September 2014,Australia
2011,I travel a lot around the world. Flew with Emirates from Stockholm to Dubai and from Dubai to Sydney and later on from Auckland to Melbourne and back to Sweden from Dubai again. All flights were on time the staff was so friendly service on the flight was top notch! Can't complain about anything really. I would travel with Emirates again that's for sure!,10,1st September 2014,Sweden
2012,DXB-JFK on the A380. Boarding and departure was delayed by nearly an hour due to the late arrival of inbound aircraft. Seats were comfortable but worn out. No footrests but legroom was great especially at the back of the plane when it started to curve. Entertainment system as expected is simply the best in the industry. The choices of movie shows music and cool things like exterior cameras is virtually endless. However this was the only exceptional part of the flight. Flight attendants with the exception of one or two looked exhausted disinterested and frankly very rude. I've never encountered such bad mannered and grumpy flight attendants. I've had wonderful and memorable crews on domestic flights here in the United States and the crew on this flight was just a disappointment. Service calls were constantly ignored and service was extremely slow. It took them more than two hours to serve dinner that the sun already rose so it might as well be called breakfast. Catering was another disappointment while the quantity is good the quality and choice is disappointing. Omelette or scrambled eggs for breakfast? So basically it's a choice between an egg dish or an egg dish. Also the bathrooms were filthy and the cabin was a disaster. Only good part was the cool mood lighting. Overall it was a mediocre flight the hard product is competitive but Emirates' customer service from ground staff to flight attendant is just inconsistent and most of the time cold and unfriendly.,3,28th August 2014,United States
2013,Flew CAI-DXB-CAI Boeing 777-300ER on all sectors. Outbound was first day of Eid loads in Y could not have been more than 60 people. Very pleasant flight cabin crew friendly and efficient. Hot towels and a menu with 2 options lamb kofta or chicken. Seats were okay for a 3 hour flight but definitely not as comfortable as on the Qatar Airways or Egyptair 77Ws. On return flight baggage was slightly over the 30kg allowance and the baggage drop agent asked us to shift some stuff onto our carry-ons. While I have no problem with EK enforcing the 30kg rule it did seem odd as the plane was going to carry the additional 2-3kg anyway and in the end the carry-on was taken by a gate agent to the luggage hold before boarding. Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming at all times and promptly responded to passengers' requests. The service and EK Y product is what really makes a difference and of course the added advantage of flying non-stop as opposed to connecting.,5,28th August 2014,Egypt
2014,"I recently flew from Singapore to Melbourne on a Boeing 777. On the plus side the fare was extremely cheap - $79 for a round trip ticket. The food was good and the entertainment system was enjoyable - especially the selection of movies. It was an overnight flight though so I didn't use the system much. The cabin mood lighting during ""sleep"" periods was also relaxing. On the negative side the seats were quite uncomfortable and I could not recline the seat enough to attain any sufficient degree of comfort to rest. Admittedly I was travelling in Economy class but I have no trouble reclining the chair enough to fall asleep in economy class of most other major airlines. Unfortunately the Emirates chair stopped short of achieving a comfortable level of relaxation and I was only able to doze fitfully. The other thing I was disappointed with was the service. Emirates provided stickers to instruct the crew to wake us up for certain events (such as meals DFS etc). I used the sticker to instruct the crew to awake me for meals. However they did not do so. The service was also not the friendliest - though that could probably be due partially to the timing of the flight when the flight crew are undoubtedly tired too.",10,28th August 2014,Singapore
2015,"Flew EK384 BKK-HKG today my first Emirates flight in 2 years. Every time I fly this airline I swear I never will again - things have not improved. The planes are good but the cabin crew are just horrendous. Without doubt Emirates is the rudest airline I have flown and they are not improving. Instead of asking passengers to do something they demand it. Instead of asking if people would like a landing card they say ""where are you from?"" I think in the entire flight I heard one please or thank you. I really don't care if they don't enjoy their jobs but it would make for a pleasant experience for the pax if they weren't abrupt surly and clumsy. I've flown economy and business and in all instance staff attitude has been absolutely appalling. For completeness the flight was also an hour late although compared to the staff this was only a minor annoyance.",7,28th August 2014,United Kingdom
2016,Flew Sydney to Istanbul return in May and August. Booked through Qantas but didn't set foot on a Qantas plane. As a codeshare passenger you are a second class citizen. No online check-in and no seat selection you get what's left at the airport. An unnecessary stop in Bangkok with even more unnecessary duplicated security checks even we were just stepping off the plane then back on again. Flight and food were good though I always score the entertainment system that doesn't work they were able to move me to another seat (I wasn't able to sit with my wife anyway). One whinge Emirates (and other airlines) really need to police their hand luggage policies. I'm sick of having my reasonably sized cabin bag under my feet because some selfish person has put a suitcase in the overhead locker. Hand luggage is for what you need on the flight not overflow from your check-in bag.,6,28th August 2014,Australia
2017,"19th August GLA-DXB DXB-MRU. Poor experience at silver skywards check in glum emirates staff when asked about upgrading (paid) to business class told ""speak to someone at the lounge"". Upstairs at lounge was told ""there are 4 spare seats but you booked with a company so it's difficult to upgrade you"". After 10 seconds of silence I put my credit card away. Upon boarding I was told ""no seats in business class"" despite what lounge said. Flight great FA's a mix of good and poor food and drink good IFE good. DXB the usual chaos refused entry to emirates lounge as ""it's not family oriented"". A380 boarding chaotic request to pay to upgrade again met with ""it's too complicated to do"" FA's a mix of rude disinterested and superb flight good food and drink good IFE good. Flight on time. Emirates a strange mix clearly not interested in anything below gold / platinum skywards in terms of service.",10,28th August 2014,United Kingdom
2018,Traveled SIN-DXB-BCN and MXP-DXB-SIN on Economy. On the flight outbound nothing special besides the connection in Dubai the filthy and overcrowded toilets in DXB which is still not up to the standard of Changi in Singapore or HKIA and the wifi that I could never get going (and I wasn't the only one). On the flight DXB-BCN on the 380 they ran out of cold beers and had to serve warm beers declined the suggestion and opted for red wine which was also warm so I just asked for a glass of water hoping this one would be fresh. There seemed to be friction between the FA's as I was waiting for the toilet one was scolding the other in front of the passengers didn't look very professional. On the way back from MXP we got a remote stand and were transferred by bus. Nowhere to sit people sitting on the floor toilets were filthy and overcrowded. Managed to get to my gate (after a long walk) and boarded the flight. Nothing special the meal trays seem a lot skinnier than you get on Singapore Airlines or Qatar. FA's doing their job and that's it nothing like Thai Singapore or Cathay they are young but not very service oriented. And last but not least they lost my bag. I am not happy with the whole experience it is value for money because it is cheaper than most airlines but don't expect a whole new dimension it is just an OK airline with good value for money and an average service an extremely good brand positioning and an overrated self-attributed reputation with below average delivery. Business Class doesn't look anything special narrow seats on the 777 and if you're on the middle section you will be seated 3 abreast.,9,26th August 2014,Singapore
2019,"Bangkok-Hong Kong-Bangkok. I take this round trip fairly regularly. I love the A380 especially the on-board bar where I spend most of my time! I think the Emirates lounges on the ground are the best. However the flight on 20th August Hong Kong to Bangkok just did not gel. The business cabin was only a third full and there seemed to be more flight attendants than passengers. A decent time after seat belt sign was switched off we strolled back to the bar and had a pleasant drink and snack. We were then told (and not too nicely!) that if we wanted to eat we would have too return to our seats. Fair enough but I wish I had forgone the dinner presented and stayed with the snacks. My prawns with noodles was atrocious. The noodles were a dry tangled coagulated mass and impossible too eat. My companion's chicken was similarly inedible. Are these business class dinners cooked and prepared in Dubai 24 hours before? They certainly seemed to be. After dinner back to the bar where with one hour to go before landing we were told by the attendant that the bar would be closing in 10 minutes and it did. And no further service even to the seat with 20 minutes to go before even the captain announced the descent. Weather perfect no turbulence. I just had the feeling the entire cabin staff were in a ""couldn't give a damn"" frame of mind. This was disgraceful. On no other Emirates flight has this happened. I was very disappointed.",5,26th August 2014,Thailand
2020,Flew round trip from Houston to Dubai in August 2014 seated in economy class party of four. Seats are fine but cushions are on the firm side. Inflight entertainment was very good several choices of things to watch across several categories. Children enjoyed their flight having found several movies to watch received their food first with colorful cutlery had their pictures taken with flight attendant hat etc. The adults suffered from what seemed to be lacklustre customer service. Attendants were professional but seemed somewhat inexperienced; never truly felt that they valued me as a customer. All meal services experienced lack of stated item availability. Decent flight but have experienced better customer service on Qatar Sri Lankan and Singapore airlines. I may fly with them again for direct flight to UAE but if I am continuing on I will choose other airline(s).,5,20th August 2014,United States
2021,This was my first flight on both Emirates and the A380. Neither lived up to the hype. Emirates is trying to build a reputation as a premium carrier with budget prices but ultimately they failed in some crucial areas. The food was sub-par especially on the HKG-DXB leg where it was downright inedible. Flight attendants were reasonably efficient but neither particularly friendly nor very welcoming. The layover in Dubai was simply too long at 4 hours but the A380 requires extra time for transfer which brings me to the second major issue with Emirates. The A380 is a cattle carrier I will never fly again. Emirates loves those planes because they can fill them up and maximize profits with sheer volume of passengers. There are inherent flaws like the lavatories behind the cockpit that have staircases leading to them. This causes unnecessary risks and inconvenience to passengers. Another problem of course is that moving that many passengers requires extra time and increases the risk of delays and other mishaps. After an 18 hour journey we had to wait for an infuriating hour at the baggage carousel in MUC. This experience was repeated by friends who traveled on the same route a few days later. Even efficient HKG couldn't move the baggage in an acceptable time frame. For me that was not only the first flight on Emirates and the A380; it was also the last.,8,20th August 2014,Macau
2022,AMS-DXB-SYD. Both legs on A380 booked business class upgraded to first on DXB-SYD. Emirates offer top-notch one- stop connections to Australia and their partnership with Qantas provides for great fares when also adding domestic flights to one's trip. I flew SYD-BNE and BNE-PER on the same ticket and flew PER-DXB-AMS inbound. Emirates business class on the A380 in my opinion beats SQ and CX. Great seat excellent IFE bar is very pleasant on long flights good connections at DXB. Was also upgraded to first for PER-DXB-AMS on 77W which is also a great plane to fly. Business is better on the A380 but first offers the same suites on both airframes. Emirates is very reliable and offers great value for money. Food is maybe not 5* but I'd rather have a good schedule excellent seat and great IFE.,4,18th August 2014,Belgium
2023,ADL to DXB. Slow boarding and no separate lines for First and Business. ICE System had to be re-booted halfway through the flight. Business class about 70% full and still the steak dish was unavailable. Only had the choice of the other two spicy dishes. Disappointing regarding meal availability for business out of ADL. Meal table in the Business Class seat not working correctly. Slow drink service on take off Business Cabin Crew seemed new and unsure. Business class to Geneva a few weeks prior was of a much higher standard.,5,18th August 2014,United Arab Emirates
2024,MEL-CPH B777-200ER return and had a great experience. In the air warmly greeted and escorted to our seats great food and attentive service. Seats were comfortable screens were large and staff were looking for opportunities to serve. First Class lounges in Dubai are terrific. CPH 1st lounge not so. Where Dubai is spotless and easy to find in both terminals we used the CPH lounge floor was poorly signed with dirty carpets. SIN was closed outbound which was a minor inconvenience. Overall this is our second trip with Emirates Business and I would definitely travel with them again.,10,18th August 2014,Australia
2025,We flew on an Emirates ( Qantas codeshare) Sydney - Paris - Sydney. I strongly advise anyone contemplating this option to forget it. The flight goes to Bangkok where you spend 1-2 hours on the tarmac/transit lounge with the 'joys' of the dual security inspection at Bangkok airport and the usual scam of your duty free bottles etc being confiscated unless you have made the necessary arrangements before hand. Then to Dubai (another couple of hours). The total is close enough to 27 hours from Sydney to Paris. The return flight was worse. Late take off from Paris (unexplained delay nearly two hours) tushed transit in Dubai then a late take off. Then the Bangkok nonsense (and the inevitable late take off). And the food option s- if you don't eat chicken then a diet faces you. Chicken featured as one of two options on every leg every meal and complemented the chicken 'appetiser' - of course you could have chosen the Asian style fish - not an attractive dish.,10,18th August 2014,Australia
2026,Excellent trip all round. Flight EK 373 from Bangkok (BKK) to Dubai (DXB) then only 1.05 hour wait to transfer to EK039 (Airbus 380) to Birmingham (BHX). Flight attendants were superb. EK373 when serving food the attendant asked if I'd like a drink with my (pretty nice) meal so I asked for a gin and tonic - 'Would you prefer a double sir?' was the reply! Then as she was leaving she said 'Oh I may as well give you another one while I'm here save me coming back'! Great stuff! On her return to collect the tray she asked if I'd like a glass of wine 'to help your food go down'. I agreed so she then said 'Oh we only have half bottles will that do? In fact while I'm here I'll give you two so you don't go thirsty'. EK 039 to Birmingham (Boeing 777) was an excellent flight with great service yet again. On my return EK038 from BHX (777) the flight attendants were somewhat less attentive but perfectly adequate. However (and this probably was why the flight was much cheaper than normal) there was an 8.05 hour stopover at Dubai where signage and facilities were not as good as expected. However the practising of a youth orchestra and a girls choir in departures was delightful and a nice surprise which whiled away some empty hours. EK 370 from DXB to BKK was fine again the attendants not as attentive as on the outward leg and there seemed to be about 20 of them! However service was quite good although some attendants seemed to be on autopilot at times. All in all Emirates lives up to its reputation and I was more than happy with the experience. The 8 hour stopover in Dubai was a bore but that's what happens when you get a flight £400 cheaper than normal I suppose.,10,18th August 2014,Thailand
2027,RUH-DXB-MRU arrived a few hours ago. EK818 I left Riyadh last night and my flight arrived to Dubai on time. The seats were good and comfortable seats though the width is sort of small. It was a 777-300 2-3-2 configuration. Food was great! The Lounge at Dubai T3 was rather disappointing. Very busy there was some noise from the passengers outside of the lounge the internet was horrible it didn't even work because the network was overcrowded! EK701 DXB-MRU on an A380 and I had my expectations up because I've heard a lot of good things about Emirates Business class seats on the A380. The cabin wasn't full which was good (for me at least) the seat width was pretty tight because of the drink bar in each seat. Flight crew were really nice. The onboard lounge was really nice the food was good and I met a few passengers on the flight with me which was a good experience. Turbulence hit which was really strong and stayed for some time so I was sort of stuck in the lounge for some time but I was busy chatting with the crew and passengers. Flight arrived on time. This is my 1st time flying Emirates and I had higher expectations but it was OK. I would fly again if I had to and didn't have any other alternative.,5,18th August 2014,Saudi Arabia
2028,"I've travelled several times on Emirates nearly all within the Gulf region short economy class flights all fairly decent. This was my first Business Class ""long haul"" London - Dubai then Dubai - Dammam in economy as Business class was full on that sector. I have to say the reality doesn't live up to the hype. The lounge at Heathrow is nice decent selection of food. The flight was full and that told on the cabin crew who looked tired. Inflight entertainment was the best part of the journey. The seat wasn't as comfortable as some carrier I've used the food just a little above the economy standard and the wines middle of the road. No amenity bag toothbrush and razor are in little plastic bags in the toilets. Arriving at Dubai I went to use the Business lounge before my onward connection but was refused access as my onward connection was in economy. Other airlines I've travelled allow access if you have travelled inward on a Business ticket. All in all an average Business class experience but not as exceptional as the publicity would make you believe. Oh Sorry on the onboard bar was a nice touch if only it hadn't closed so early.",10,16th August 2014,United Kingdom
2029,I flew from Washington DC to Ho Chi Minh City 20 hours in economy class. I find Emirates to be quite enjoyable! The in-flight entertainment is excellent with the latest music and movies and TV. The food is excellent! I would travel with Emirates again just for the food. The only negative is the seat comfort but hey you get what you pay for with economy. Toilets are clean and staff are friendly enough. Definitely recommend. I also stayed overnight in Dubai at the Copthorne Airport Hotel and I'd recommend that too.,10,14th August 2014,United States
2030,SEA to DXB. Boeing 777 business class. The actual experience did not live up to all the hype. Had business class seat in Row 8 the bulkhead. Rather than an A/V screen as part of my seat my screen was bolted to the bulkhead. Made for poor viewing experience. Also found the handheld controller to be ridiculously slow. Getting from my window seat to the aisle was a mountain goat experience when the adjacent seat was in sleeping position. Was also surprised to learn the 777 seat was not a 180 degree fully lie flat. Staff were pleasant and attentive but not any more so than British Air or Lufthansa. Food the same as BA and LH. Emirates arrival terminal in Dubai is excellent!,9,14th August 2014,United States
2031,DXB to SIN. Airbus A380 business class Dubai to Singapore. Far superior to the Emirates 777 business class seat. Fully flat seat. Loved the walk-up bar and personal refreshment center at my seat. Once again staff just so-so and not better on average than British Air or Lufthansa.,4,14th August 2014,United States
2032,The worst economy flight I have had. The seat was good but the legroom wasn't. The IFE was very nice lots of German movies. Staff were awful. The flight FRA-DXB: Flight was 35 minutes delayed. After take off: Flight attendants went off for about 30 minutes! On our other flights: DXB-SGN: 3 hours delayed SGN-DXB: 1 hour delay. Staff were very slow. They walked 3 times trough the cabin but they didn't see the reclined seat the open seat belt and the fold down table. My bag was on the seat and not in the overhead compartment. The food was good but I will never fly again with Emirates.,9,11th August 2014,China
2033,Caught EK71 from Dubai to Paris and it was simply stunning. Staff were fantastic from start to finish food was great and I have no complaints whatsoever. This is one of the worlds great airlines and is really setting the standard for others to follow or not as is the case.,5,11th August 2014,Australia
2034,We had a long journey. We flew from Zurich to Hong Kong continued to Bangkok and travelled to Sydney and then all the way back to Switzerland. The Cabin Crew were always very friendly and taking care of our needs. The meals could be better. We will fly Emirates again!,8,11th August 2014,Switzerland
2035,EK6 London to Dubai on 24/25th July and EK 412 Dubai to Sydney on 25th July. Having experienced other airlines in the past we found Emirates to be the worst. The Flight Attendants were rude I lost count how many times they rush past down the aisle and knocked my elbow while I was trying to sleep -there was no apology. Food took forever to be served and by the time they got to you there was no choice as it was whatever was left. Drinks you would think they were paying for them you had to ask for them and when you did it was like you asked them for gold or something. We had to remain on the plane in Dubai for 3 hours before take off to Sydney it was very hot and stuffy after 2 hours of waiting the flight attendant's finally decided to give us some water or juice as everyone was asking for water even then they begrudgingly gave us drinks. Coffee and tea was served half an hour after you had finish your meals and even then it was lukewarm and you only received half a cup. Trays were left in front of you for about an hour and people that had special meals were fed first therefore if they were sitting in front of you and they had finished eating they would put their seat back and you had to manage your tray under your chin until they were collected. My experience with Emirates is definitely memorable but for the negative reasons and I would definitely not recommend them to anyone.,7,6th August 2014,Australia
2036,June 13th EK433 BNE-DXB with overnight stay at Transit Hotel and on to FRA with EK 45. Boeing 777ER. At Brisbane Airport plane missed turn to active Runway 19 and had to be pushed back resulting in 45 min delay. Apart from that delay everything went well. Unfortunately Emirates still has the 3-4-3 configuration which makes for extremely cramped conditions. Food and Drink service was efficient and even service calls were answered promptly. Toilets were kept clean. In Dubai I stayed at the Transit Hotel and was greeted by a Porter as requested. That is a great service they offer. I would have had big problems finding the hotel. Highly recommended if you need a rest from your travels even though a bit on the pricey side. Next morning after a good rest it was on to Frankfurt.,5,3rd August 2014,Australia
2037,EK 088 ZRH-DXB 17th July 2014 Airbus A380. What a difference to the B777ER. Wider seats and more legroom plus a big TV screen. ICE worked to a treat and can keep you entertained on these long haul flights. DBX-BNE B777ER. Cabin crew were attentive on both flights but food offered was nothing to write home about. Will fly Emirates again but try to get on the A380 first even if I have to go via Sydney or Melbourne to Europe.,7,3rd August 2014,Australia
2038,July 25 2014 from Hong Kong to Dubai on EK383. I always travel economy class with Emirates. Amongst all the airlines I've travelled they are one of the best in customer service punctuality fairness seat comfort etc. I'm extremely picky when I travel and so far I have not found a chance to complain. My only concern during a couple of the flights (2/10) was that the inflight entertainment monitor could not get adjusted very well.,5,3rd August 2014,Canada
2039,I did the long haul from Gatwick-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney in economy for all but one leg when I was in business class. I tried to upgrade the other sections five times over three weeks and was given the run around each time including at the airport three hours before departure. Turns out the plane was full on every leg so they could have saved me time and angst. The crew in economy looked unhappy without exception and were overworked and brusque. Seat comfort was what you could expect - but narrow seats made sleeping very hard. Luckily my fellow travellers were sanguine about the heat stuffiness and general mayhem. Not an experience I want to repeat especially after they lost our bags.,4,31st July 2014,Australia
2040,27 June 2014 HYD-DXB EK 529. 28 June 2014 DXB-HYD EK 203. I have been travelling EK between US and India since 2011. One of the best aspects of EK is that they keep changing their products which makes the passenger experience exciting. This time it was a whole new experience on the A380 between DXB-JFK: the food is simply superb the presentation style has changed - better trays and plates a mini-snack bar with crackers and dips food quality and quantity are great the ICE continues to exceed my expectations and it was lovely to watch it on ipad style 12 inch HD screens with a smooth-touch screen remote! The flight between HYD-DXB on B777-200LR was good older IFEs even with 3-4-3 seat configuration it was comfortable [I am 5'5] but the food was simply excellent! I love the fact that EK gives a hot towel lime water [on flights between DXB and India] a menu card and stainless cutlery for Economy. However it would be nice if the flight attendants could learn to smile more but they always seem to be in a hurry. Overall EK is the most enjoyable way to fly!,5,31st July 2014,United States
2041,Flew economy with my wife Sydney to Dubai 17 July and Dubai to Barcelona 18 July. Both flights flawless. Food definitely edible trays cleared away promptly tea and coffee served after the meal when the trays were being collected. Drink runs every hour or so. Snacks available at each galley during flights. Arrival into Barcelona nearly an hour early but only downside was that baggage took some time to arrive on the carousel. Inflight entertainment superb with huge selection of movies and TV programmes.,7,29th July 2014,New Zealand
2042,Flying from Hong Kong back to the UK on flight EK383 on Thursday 17 July our flight was delayed due to bad weather for four hours some time was made up and arrived in Dubai and the flight EK021 to Manchester was still boarding. Told our seats had been re allocated the result - a five hour wait in Dubai waiting for the next flight. Emirates had jumped the gun so to speak. Why?,5,29th July 2014,United Kingdom
2043,Return Biz class ticket purchased with EK from Muscat to Beijing. On arrival at DXB airport following the flight from Beijing with a 3 hour wait - barred from using the EK Business lounges in Dubai and told that as it is a code share on the last sector (EK ticket) I would not be able to use the Emirates facilities at Dubai airport but must instead use Oman Air! Staff on the business lounge desk most unhelpful. Following a very long walk through DXB airport to terminal 1 no Oman air lounge was found so option was Gulf Air - who (unlike Emirates airline ground staff) were extremely helpful and friendly! Note for the future - avoid flying Emirates business class if possible!,10,29th July 2014,Oman
2044,QF10 for LHR-DXB connecting to EK380 from DXB-HKG. For the second part of my flight the Emirates A380 experience is just slightly overrated. To start with you could tell that some of the cabin crew were experienced and some were just very new to their job one tried to help a passenger climb over two seats for a toilet run during meal service but were quite clumsy when she dropped the tray of food entirely spilling everything on the aisle. Nevertheless it was evident that the cabin crew tried very hard to impress. What was annoying was the amount of commercials they had on their video screens - other airlines just have safety demonstration videos prior to takeoff but theirs include videos on Dubai the ICE entertainment and skyawards which was slightly unnecessary. The food quality wasn't as good as what was offered aboard Qantas but was still satisfactory. Even if Emirates have been praised over and over again I think it still needs to improve its service consistency and still is not in the same league with airlines such as CX and SQ.,6,27th July 2014,Hong Kong
2045,EK161 DXB to DUB on 16 July and EK384 DXB to BKK on 17 June. We still look forward to a decent experience on Emirates that I have read about here on airlinequality.com. Interestingly people I have recently spoken to have also shared negative experiences on Emirates - I guess we have just been unlucky. Inconsistency is clearly a problem. Some of our sectors were on Qantas and we found the service to be of a much higher standard on Qantas and they were also more family friendly than Emirates. Ultimately we don't have massive expectations in terms of service in economy on any airline but Emirates service was dismissive at times rude and you had to beg for basics like water. I travel on a variety of airlines for work and the Emirates service was similar to that of a very bad US airline. Anyway we arrived intact with all luggage accounted for so not all bad. Would avoid if possible in the future.,10,27th July 2014,Ireland
2046,I flew AKL-MEL-DXB-JNB with a minor stop in DUR due to OR Tambo Airport (JNB) being closed due to severe weather. Wheels up at Auckland as EK407 at 6.00pm on an Airbus A380 for a 4 hour flight to Melbourne. The food on the first leg to MEL was excellent. It was Mediterranean chicken. We were in MEL for 1.45 hours to fuel up and pick up/drop passengers off. The second leg was 15 hours to Dubai from Melbourne but with the great in flight entertainment systems and comfy seats the time flew past quickly. Early morning arrival into Dubai at 5.20am then for a 5 hour wait to catch flight EK763 which was a Boeing 777-300ER. Great flight until we hit severe turbulence over the middle of Africa. We dropped a couple of feet which was scary but the EK staff kept us calm and served us refreshments after the turbulence had past. Just before we were about to descend into Johannesburg we were diverted to Durban due to bad weather in JNB. We were in Durban for 2 hours but we weren't allowed off the plane. But the EK staff were excellent they gave us refreshments and they were mingling with the passengers. Highly recommend flying with Emirates great seats (economy) in-flight entertainment systems are excellent and the staff are impeccable. I flew JNB-DXB-SYD-AKL on the way back home with the same excellent service.,1,22nd July 2014,New Zealand
2047,NBO-DXB-SGN on 20-21 July 2014. Travels on Boeings 777-300 and 777-200 respectively. Flights on time. Wonderful service from ground staff throughout. Smooth hotel stay (all inclusive) provided and perfectly arranged by EK in DXB due to long transfer. I was only dissatisfied in DXB with a 40 minutes bus ride from aircraft to gate in the middle of the night - unbelievable and extremely tiring. On board: FAs of superior kindness alertness and professionalism. IFE outstanding. Food: Special meal provided. Other passengers were provided with three options all of acceptable quality. Many soft drinks available. 3 options for beers but all industrial waterish and with a boring taste. Wines tolerable there were 2 red wines in mini bottles and 1 white-wine. DXB-SGN was another tiresome new bus ride for 45 Minutes (including a stop for 20 minutes standing as planes were taxiing. Economy cabin was completely full. Food even better than on the previous flight including special meal. Drinks very generous. Staff did well despite a very crowded economy cabin. Too many seats squeezed in (3-4-3 configuration) which make extremely narrow aisles which hardly can accommodate a trolley. Compared to Qatar Airways Emirates appear to be regaining the lead as (apart from DXB bus experience) they are overall more professional even to customers without status cards.,9,22nd July 2014,Denmark
2048,Gatwick to Singapore with a 20 hour stopover in Dubai. Difficult to beat Emirates business class on the A380 in terms of value for money. Only complaint is the shortage of toilets.,7,22nd July 2014,United Kingdom
2049,Brisbane - Auckland return on A380. Used online check-in both ways and service was great. Completed bag drop very quickly and efficiently in both directions. This was my first return flight Bris-Auck on their A380. Had travelled Dubai/Heathrow Auck/Bris prior to this. Not disappointed. Flight time a lot quicker than 777 and A340 previously used on this route. Boarding was as quick as the smaller aircraft. In the past I have avoided seats in front of the bulkhead however found. Row 50 has plenty of space to recline which avoids disputes with the passenger behind and also gets you off the aircraft quicker.,5,22nd July 2014,Australia
2050,We have traveled 8 international legs with Emirates in the past 16 months so we have had a good opportunity to check out this airline. It is our experience that they are so focused on their business and first class customers that they do not care about economy despite the huge number of passengers that they cram into economy seating. Food takes so long to be served to economy customer that if you are seated towards the back it is cold once it eventually arrives. It is also our experience that you can expect to have you dinner tray on your tray table for at least on hour after you have finished. Service other than for meals is almost non existent and economy is severely understaffed. Legs out of Dubai to Sydney are particularly bad and the check in processes in Dubai simply terrible - long queues and slow processing. Inflight movies limited. Every time we have flown from Dubai to Sydney there has been a huge hassle with our seating despite having booked our seats months in advance. One time my husband and I were not seated together despite having been allocated seating together - they gave our seats to a sporting group. It is our opinion that this airline does not care about economy class customers. We have flown with many other airlines so have a good idea of the basic standard that one would expect in economy and in our opinion Emirates does not meet event the most basic standard.,9,22nd July 2014,Australia
2051,Flew 2 weeks ago from Ho Chi Minh city (SGN) - (DXB - transit) - LHR (London) and back. My first time flying with Emirates. I was served with a hot towel and was able to watch my a film during take off. After flying for 5 hours I needed my bag with me. Unfortunately it was in the locker which was too high for me to reach so when I saw a flight attendant pass by I asked her if she could help. She helped me open the locker eventually but her attitude left me disappointed! On my way back from DXB to SGN I was lucky to have a lovely flight crew. In general the on board entertainment was very impressive. Even though the hot meals were served quickly they didn't taste good the food was incredibly salty and I couldn't finish it. The desserts on the other hand were the best amongst airlines.,6,20th July 2014,Vietnam
2052,A recent trip to Europe with Qantas/Emirates involved three legs with Emirates and one (Dubai to Sydney) with Qantas. Two of the Emirates legs were OK but the leg from Barcelona to Dubai was not up to any realistic standard for economy let alone business class. The food was barely edible (my wife's was inedible) and the service was appalling. No tea or coffee offered after the meal and resentment shown when my wife asked for some. They basically left us alone except for serving the meal. three previous flights with Emirates have been much better. other aspects of the flight (on time check in etc were fine and the Dubai terminal is excellent). The Qantas link with Emirates also works well if flying into Europe without having to go through London. Saves a lot of time.,8,20th July 2014,Australia
2053,EK 88 ZRH-DXB 05/03/14. EK 318 DXB-NRT 05/04/14. EK 317 KIX-DXB 05/14/14. EK 87 DXB-ZRH 05/15/14. The best I have experienced! From the chauffeur service to check-in and boarding the service was excellent. The A380 with the shower onboard is fantastic. Food and beverages excellent. I would highly recommend Emirates.,3,20th July 2014,Switzerland
2054,Flew economy LGW-AK all cabin crew excellent. Seats on 777 LGW-DUB dub cramped 3x4x3 config. A380 could not fault - great service on all 4 flights.,10,20th July 2014,Spain
2055,EK0025 DXB-GLA on 25/11/13 EK0048 FRA-DXB on 4/2/14 and EK434 DXB-BNE on 5/2/14. Poor service. Food is terrible. Ads before watching anything on in-flight entertainment are annoying and seem unnecessary. Treatment of economy passengers is one of disdain as though you are an inconvenience.,7,17th July 2014,Australia
2056,Quick trip to London last weekend. First time on Emirates and not the last. Haven't flown for a long time due to illness and the impatient and entitled behaviour of passengers was disappointing to see as the crew has a difficult job already trying to navigate people's expectations. I have nothing negative to say. Check-in was a breeze each way. Food was fantastic and plentiful. Travelling with children can be stressful at any time but saw crew assisting them and parents with respect and care. Am travelling long-haul again twice in the next 3 months. I'll be going with Emirate again for those.,None,17th July 2014,Australia
2057,SYD-DXB-DUB. DUB-DXB. I have mixed feelings about Emirates. I was very impressed with the efficiency of meal service and taking up the trays when finished (some airlines leave you waiting for ages). On the other hand on the Sydney to Dubai leg the crew were very straight faced and wouldn't crack a smile. It was as if they had a timetable of stuff to do and any other communication was an inconvenience to them. A cabin crew member was very rude pushing by me as I was waiting for the bathroom and she did not excuse herself. I asked for a second wine when all meals and clean up etc. had eased off and was left 40 minutes waiting and had to search out the guy I asked. From Dubai to Dublin was the same experience minus the wine. Food was awful - stale rock hard croissant was included in the breakfast. On the way back I had trouble with my travel agent booking and the ground staff in Dublin were very kind and helpful. The Dublin to Dubai leg was very enjoyable - crew seemed happy and engaged with passengers and food was slightly better that my trip from Sydney to Dublin. I would recommend plunger coffee - Emirates serve instant. Each plane was very comfortable. I could stretch out - I am 5'7' and my partner is 6ft and a large build. We were very impressed with the comfort on both the a380 and the 777. Entertainment was my lifesaver.,8,15th July 2014,Australia
2058,"Flew Emirates for the 4th time and the in-flight experience keeps on getting better and better! After flying thrice on-board Emirates between the KHI-DXB sector in the past my recent trip with the same airline consisted of two sectors: KHI-DXB-IST (EK601 & EK123) and IST-DXB-KHI (EK 122 & EK600). Aircraft's were their B777-300(ER) which I love although some people might find the 3-4-3 configuration to be a little cramped. The B777-300(ER) aircraft's operated on the two flights during my inbound journey (A6-ENO and A6-ENI) were some of the latest in the fleet and their seats were equipped with the all new ICE Digital Screen which consists of a 12"" IFE Touchscreen and a touch-enabled remote control. Food and beverages were great with sufficient meals and a good variety of drinks. Staff service was good as well. Overall it was an excellent journey.",8,15th July 2014,Pakistan
2059,I have flown with Emirates on and off for the last 10 years and have enjoyed great service over the years and seen a lot of improvements. My most recent flight was LGW to DXB on the A380. This plane is great and the bar / lounge is a must not just a gimmick as seen on other airlines. My only negative is that the meal service has been steadily declining over the years. First the 'As You like It' menu disappears and now it seems that to obtain a glass of wine with your meal you have to wait until you have nearly finished for the wine to appear. Its the little touches that make flying Emirates a pleasure but they need to be maintained otherwise Qatar and Etihad with their dine on demand will gain more business.,10,12th July 2014,Australia
2060,BKK-DXB-HAM. BKK-DXB Morning Flight EK375 - long check-in queue but check-in staff at Bangkok were friendly. Delayed 30 mins due to waiting for all passengers to finish boarding. A380 full but still roomy in Y (great aircraft) no highlight - same experience as inbound flight in May - very slow service. As the lunch tray arrived to my row it was cold - quality and quantity under 4 stars airline standard. DXB-HAM on EK 61 (B777-300ER) flight full/ no more to say about the feeling of 3-4-3 seating. On this flight the crew was very rude inexperienced and the poorest inflight-service I have received on EK - very chaotic no system. Crews forgot which seat rows they have already served drinks to and which rows they had not. After meals passengers sitting in seats A to E were served drinks tea or coffee twice while the left hand side passengers (F to K) did not get any. Hours later crews noted this mistake during the collecting of meal trays as the coffee cups were unused and it was too late to serve as we were on landing process and no apology came.,2,8th July 2014,Germany
2061,ABJ-DXB-SIN June 22nd-23rd. Good experience overall. Emirates staff improved its service since our previous flights one year ago. On board service is good beverages offered very regularly including on night flights. Food and snacks are excellent. IFE was excellent on the Dubai-Singapore leg but quite average on the Abidjan-Dubai one. Both legs were on B777 and the 3-4-3 seat configuration is quite uncomfortable especially for a 2 times 8 hours journey. But the main setback remains the transfer at Dubai with this incredible and uncomfortable 20 min bus drive from the plane to terminal 3 a bit problematic if you have a short time connection and have to queue to security check and walk across those long corridor to reach your departing gate something Emirates whose traffic is mostly longhaul transited through this Airport should fix.,10,6th July 2014,
2062,Flew on a round trip from Jakarta to Newcastle via Dubai. Once again I was not disappointed flying Emirates. The cabin crew are attentive and have an excellent attitude. The food and entertainment system are the best in the business. Previously queues at Dubai airport security checkpoint for transit passengers could be a nightmare but this has improved drastically with the introduction of a 'snake' queuing system. I was through security in less than 10 minutes while in transit. The only things that could be improved by Emirates are: 1) It could remove the 10-abreast seating arrangement in Economy class on its 777 fleet and switch to a standard 9-abreast arrangement as seats are currently too narrow. 2) A snackbox on the galley similar to that of the British Airways 'tuckbox' would be a useful addition. Nevertheless Emirates will always remain one of my first choice airlines based on my experiences with them so far.,10,6th July 2014,Indonesia
2063,We arrived in London Gatwick for our 13.35 flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed 6 hours and would not take off until 19.00 so we asked to move/change our connecting flight from Dubai (knowing that we would have missed it for sure) but were told multiple times that it could not be done in the UK but it would have been done quickly in Dubai airport transfer desk. When we arrived in Dubai airport all the serious problems started as we went to the infamous transfer desk and found more than a 1000 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood queuing for about 6/7 hours with no refreshments and in a very warm environment. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At around 12/12.30 so after nearly 6/7 hours (standing queuing sweating with no water or possibility to go to the toilet) we were finally moved onto another flight leaving at 23.00 (further 11 hours wait) we were handed out only 1 food voucher each even if we had to wait 18 hours inside Dubai airport and although we waited so long Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. The food vouchers were used for breakfast but when we went back to ask for more vouchers for lunch/dinner we were told that they were all finish so We had to pay for our own lunch and dinner. Worst customer service ever lack of communication lack of organization and lack of care for customers. Definitely would not recommend also Airline refuses to compensate blaming natural causes when they had more than a day to prepare for all the delayed planes to arrive and the fog was only the day before for 2/3 hours.,3,6th July 2014,United Kingdom
2064,Flew EK385 - A380 BKK to DXB and EK27 - 777-300er DXB to GLA on 5th July. Flew in Economy on both legs and have to say that I was very impressed by the cabin crew who were extremely helpful and friendly on both flights and did an outstanding professional job in looking after me. Food was adequate and very tasty. Planes very modern clean and safety was paramount and the pilots were very exceptional on both flights informing everyone of the route turbulence etc. ICE was very good with plenty up to date movies to keep everyone entertained. I was lucky to be given 3 seats to myself on EK27 even though the flight was fully booked. Both flights were on time and arrived early at both destinations. I really enjoyed my flights and cannot find any faults or complaints.,4,6th July 2014,United Kingdom
2065,Flew from Dubai to Delhi on 26th June 2014 and back to Dubai on 6th July2014. The aircraft was a Boeing 777-300 in both the cases. The aircraft was neat and clean but was a bit cramped. The staff isn't that courteous though. The IFE system seemed very old. Overall it was a good experience.,8,6th July 2014,United Arab Emirates
2066,Flew BCN-DXB on 23/06 in an A380. Comfortable roomy. Excellent IFE although I didn't avail myself of the myriad of choices - too many violent films. I found that the controls are not all that user friendly (flying to/from Europe). Pleasant staff. Food was fine. Arrived Dubai 00.50 am (24/06) and we had 70 minutes to transfer to our connecting flight. When I requested a priority transfer whilst checking in at Barcelona the staff member was disinterested and unhelpful. It took a lot of fast walking and anxiety but we made our 02.05 am connection DXB- ADL. The Boeing 777 made me realise what cattle class is. Cramped and the seats are appallingly uncomfortable. For the 12hr journey we were served breakfast and lunch hot pizza snacks were handed out only to awake passengers. Chocolate bars and fruit were readily available. Very pleasant staff. The toilets were kept pristine on both legs - very impressed. Aisles in the Boeing are very narrow so that when one is walking for exercise or to the toilet one is constantly bumping other passengers. In our hurry to get our connecting DXB-ADL flight my husband left our camera in the seat pocket of the A38! We spoke to the site manager on our arrival in Adelaide (24/06) and gave him the necessary details. The next day (25/06) I received a call from the Emirates office in Adelaide Airport to say that the camera had been located and that it would arrive on the DXB-ADL flight on Thursday night. So professional so helpful.,3,1st July 2014,Australia
2067,First class on this brand new A380-800 from New York to Dubai is truly an excellent flying experience. From the time you board to the time you disembark in Dubai you would never know that you're traveling with 500 other pax! I'm always amazed how Emirates is able to create such an exclusive travel experience in first class while also meeting the demands of the other fellow passengers on the plane. The private suite is spacious the personalized service exceptional the IFE works very well. And then of course there is the shower. Just after take off you book a slot for your pre-arrival shower and this does make a difference after a 13+ hour flight for you walk off that flight feeling refreshed and clean and smelling good.,10,30th June 2014,Singapore
2068,I have had 2 return journeys with Emirates to the Seychelles via Dubai from Heathrow within the last 3 months (EK002 & 3) and from Dubai to Seychelles and back and I have to say I was really shocked at how under-performing the cabin crew were. On those separate four journeys I found the Cabin Crew miserable sarcastic rude and looking like they really would like to be anywhere other than where they were. In a nutshell I have left the planes on each occasion really rather appalled at the lack of customer service and I have no wish to fly again with them anytime soon. On one of the flights food was almost thrown at us and scrambling to find anything to give to us as we were last rows of seats on my most recent flight back from Dubai the stewardess just before landing said I will be back (she was collecting blankets and headsets and checking seats were upright etc) but we never saw her again. Air Seychelles I have been told don't fair any better but on my next trip I shall be trying them out flying from Paris direct to the Seychelles which they start from July and see how they do compare because I really don't want to fly Emirates again!,8,30th June 2014,United Kingdom
2069,Flight from Newcastle to Brisbane via Dubai and Singapore. We booked in August with Emirates staff promising seats that would be allocated for me being disabled I have severe walking problems that require me to be able to stand up and stretch my legs. What I got were seats in row 37 seats D and E just getting to the seats was extremely hard as I need to use a crutch to walk with the aisles are too narrow to move to the seats while using a crutch. I will never fly with them again.,7,30th June 2014,United Kingdom
2070,Flying the A380 from Hong Kong to Dubai in business class you wonder if there is really any point to pay extra for suites given the amazing product that Emirates has in biz class. This was a new A380 with the improved biz seat and a great IFE system. This flight was pure perfection. Well done Emirates.,10,25th June 2014,Singapore
2071,Unfortunately Emirates used an older 777-300ER on this 14+ hour route which is a shame. The biz seat is not entirely flat - the ever so slight angle still makes you slide down when you sleep. I would have preferred to see them use a newer 777-300ER on this route with the full flat bed and place this equipment on a shorter route where sleeping is less important than on an ultra-long haul route. Besides that the service the food the IFE are superb and live up to the Emirates standard.,1,25th June 2014,Singapore
2072,12/6/14 EK355 SIN-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Interior well maintained despite plane being 7-8 years old. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like SQ and CX does. Dinner service 1.5 hrs after take off and drinks another 30m later. People's throats were parched by then. People then begun pressing call buttons this could have been avoided if a simple drink run was done. Food was really good with choices between sweet and sour chicken and beef with mashed potatoes. I had the former and dessert was good too. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. No drink runs nor snacks provided after that although menu said so that was disappointing so 1 star less for F&B.,4,23rd June 2014,Singapore
2073,21/6/14 EK354 DXB-SIN. Boarding not by zones this time and some confusion occurred at the gate. Middle aged aircraft by EK's standards 4.4 years old well maintained interior but my seat pocket had a bit of uncleared rubbish. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Due to this passengers kept pressing call buttons to ask for drinks. Snack service 1h15m after take off and drinks another 30m later. Breakfast was 3h before landing. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies same as DXB-CDG. This time the sandwich was rock hard and the cookies weren't as good they were soft and weren't baked enough. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach (Same as DXB-CDG) and fried noodles with siewmai. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff but was more bland this time creamed spinach bad this time. There were also fewer potato wedges and they were soggy. Fruits were fresh. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was good on this flight. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around twice after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. Landing was smoothest of 4 legs. After landing during disembarkation I requested to a cabin crew to allow me up to business and first class to have a look. She asked the chief stewardess and got a nod. She then enthusiastically showed me around the upper deck and I was amazed at how luxurious it was. I thanked her profusely after that. Good service from her. As usual EK is really good if you get a good crew. Only disappointment this flight was the food.,2,23rd June 2014,Singapore
2074,Beirut-Dubai. Seats were comfortable check in was smooth food was normal and crew responded on time.,10,23rd June 2014,United Arab Emirates
2075,"Flew BKK/SYD 21 June 14. Flight was on time and boarding was efficient and well handled. Staff were professional and friendly with regular water/juice ""runs"" during the night flight. IFE Restroom cleanliness and food quality were at the top of what you expect in economy. Couple of little things that overall left a sour taste from the experience: Arrival cards weren't handed out until exiting the aerobridge on deboarding. Possibly an oversight. The 3-4-3 layout is a real impediment to them living up to their (often announced during the flight) award winning service. 17"" width is simply to little and the extra seat makes the aisles ridiculously narrow to navigate for staff and passengers. My experience is a 3-3-3 format in a 773 is a far more comfortable experience for all. Most budget carriers have the 3-4-3 format however at least on them you don't have further discomfort of impeded foot room ( no IFE boxes under seats.) I guess the extra 50 (?) in carrying capacity is the overarching criteria. Cant help but think the contingent negativity created among passengers overrules the benefits of being able to move the maximum number of people.",8,23rd June 2014,Australia
2076,DXB-CMB First Suites B777-300ER. Connected from a BA flight in DXB. EK is not efficient anymore if transferring from another airline with very few staff at the transit desk in Terminal 3. Thankfully a staff member at a non- transfer counter across the corridor saw me waiting and called me over. Although the process was slow he politely issued my boarding pass after confirming that my bags had transferred from BA to EK. The EK First Class Lounge was excellent with attentive staff a nice business center and very good buffet or menu dining options. Boarding was somewhat disorganized as usual. Staff welcomed me at the door showed me my suite and took my welcome drink order. There were two staff members for the five passengers (out of eight suites) with one very attentive and the other indifferent and inexperienced. The suite is very well designed if rather garish but is comfortable and functions well except for the rather awkward sliding doors. No amenity kit is given on the 4.5 hour night flight and no duvet/comforter is offered except for a thick blanket. I had booked a seafood meal online and it was insulting to be served an omelette that looked as though a child had cooked it and contained about a teaspoon of salmon! As one who uses CX and BA First Class and recalls what EK used to do a few years ago this is a huge disappointment. This is a very profitable route for EK yet it is cutting back even in First despite rising fuel costs not yet affecting UAE airlines. As a loyal Silver Tier Skywards EK customer I am concerned to this once outstanding airline is slipping especially when the competition is trying harder on this route. My bags were on the carousel in CMB after I cleared immigration.,4,23rd June 2014,United States
2077,20/6/14 EK88 ZRH-DXB. Boarding very orderly by zones. Pretty new aircraft of 1.3 years old. 85% Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. This time drinks came with salted biscuits 40m after take off. Dinner service 2h30m after take off and drinks came 30m later. This left many passengers parched and kept asking crew for drinks which they weren't very happy to oblige on this leg. There was no menu as well not sure if crew forgot or there was insufficient. Dinner was really good with choices between salmon with saffron risotto and grilled chicken breast with mashed potatoes. I had the latter. Chicken breast a little dry but went well with the sauce. My mother had the salmon and the risotto was really delicious. Dessert of lemon torte was really good and I could have had multiple servings. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Staff service was terrible on this flight the worst flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Hardly any smiles during service which honestly does not matter call buttons by other passengers went unanswered. No drinks service after the meal service. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they obliged. I asked for 2 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and a rude male crew told me to get back to my seat and ask for it later. Not recommended this time. On a positive note a family of passengers who ordered Indian vegetarian meals didn't have their meals loaded and a female cabin crew were extremely helpful even going to business class to get a sandwich for them.,10,23rd June 2014,Singapore
2078,13/6/14 EK71 DXB-CDG. Boarding very orderly by zones. Sparkling new aircraft of 0.6 years old. Full flight. IFE as usual very good with ICE being top notch. Too many things to watch and do. There's even a customer service survey under the C component. I didn't like that there were no drink runs done after take off not even a tray of drinks like what SQ and CX does. Snack service 1h after take off and drinks another 30m later. Snack consisted of a roasted chicken sandwich and chocolate chip pecan cookies. Breakfast was really good with choices between omelette with creamed spinach and scrambled eggs with hash browns. I had the former. Omelette didn't taste like airplane stuff creamed spinach really good. Fruits were fresh too. I like that they provide croissants in addition to normal bread made me feel like I'm in France already. Drinks service was really generous and there was no limit on the number of drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic that you could take. Even during breakfast drink service you could ask for alcohol and no questions asked. Staff service was really good on this flight the best flight out of the 4 legs I flew with them. Smiles during service call buttons answered promptly and drink trays brought around after meal service for people who turn thirsty quickly like myself. I went to the galley to ask for my bottle to be refilled and they even asked me to sit down and they'll return the bottle to me. I asked for 3 boxes of playing cards as souvenir and they obliged as well with a smile. Excellent service beats SQ on this leg. EK is really good if you get an awesome crew like this.,8,23rd June 2014,Singapore
2079,SFO-DXB-CGK on 20th June. Flight out of SFO got delayed for 4 hours. Lounge manager at SFO not helpful at all on the border of being unprofessional. Business class seats are small. Otherwise all other services are fine.,10,23rd June 2014,Indonesia
2080,Toronto to Dubai Dubai to Perth then Perth to Dubai and Dubai to Toronto. EK 242 EK 422 EK 421 EK 241. The seat was comfortable the food was good and the service was great. The only two things I didn't like was the lack of self serve snacks and the amount of time it took for the crew to clear the meal trays.,8,23rd June 2014,Canada
2081,Flew Copenhagen-Dubai-Seoul and back. The seat in economy was rather large. The food was quite good - not the best I've had on a flight but definitely not the worst. There was apparently no limit on how many drinks and snacks you could ask for - a major bonus especially on long flights. There were lots of movies on the inflight entertainment and many of the English-language movies also had subtitles which is really nice because it's difficult to hear everything due to the noise from the engines.,1,20th June 2014,Denmark
2082,Flew to Los Angeles in April. Food on the 04.30 am flight from Bangalore to Dubai was terrible as usual. The flights on the double decker A380 aircraft from Dubai to LAX and back was very comfortable. The massive queues to board the aircraft long queues at check-in and the scramble for the baggage at LAX airport will deter me from choosing this aircraft in future. It took me 2 hours to get my baggage at LAX airport and with 500 pax searching for their suitcases it was a total mess! Food portions on the flight were very small and food was disappointing. For a 16 hour flight the in between meal snacks were just fruits and chocolates which vanished soon and were never refilled. The crew were unfriendly. Ask for a drink and it never comes until you remind them thrice. Very disappointed. The food on the Dubai/Bangalore sector was excellent.,8,20th June 2014,India
2083,"More food please! On a trip from SYD to London we were only served 2 meals and one ""light bite"". That's over 23 hrs flying with just 2 measly meals. Meal service is appalling. No drinks or snacks served. No pre-drinks served before meals or at any time during the flight. Drinks (tea coffee juice wine etc) served over 30 mins after meals are delivered. No second round of tea /coffee served Service is slow milk and sugar need to be requested and served separately and this takes forever By the time tea is served it is cold and too late after the meal has been eaten.",9,20th June 2014,Australia
2084,Vastly overrated. The staff may be good at delivering food but have very little idea of what service means. I did 5 sectors in first and met one Purser and one person who claimed to be in charge of the first class cabin. On two sectors I was addressed by my name on three I was just another person. Staff seem to not want to engage with passengers or communicate with them except to take food orders. On two sectors I had to go and search for cabin staff - none seemed to be around when found they were all talking in the galley and appeared upset that I had interrupted them. As best I can determine there is only one first class lounge and that is in Dubai all the others are business class shared with first. On the plus side the suites are great and the beds excellent.,1,20th June 2014,Australia
2085,Upgraded from Economy to Business SYD-DXB on A380. Sydney lounge is one of the best around with respect to the food and wines. Best breakfast lounge menu ever. A380 business class seat superb rivals Cathay although I'm not sure why it needs touchscreen + handset + tablet to operate the IFE. That said it all worked seamlessly and very good quality screen. Food was fantastic from the main meals served to the in between meals (a highlight) to the finger food in the lounge at the rear of the plane. The lounge is fantastic - it sets them apart from the other high quality business offerings pity it's only on A380s but then they have a massive A380 fleet anyway. Staff were great but a little over friendly at times. Will be my first choice from now on.,10,20th June 2014,Australia
2086,DXB-CDG and NCE-DXB-SYD. Great economy class with comfortable seats great IFE quality food (particularly impressive) and very good staff. Difficult to fault. Lounges are mixed bag DXB terminal C for breakfast wasn't great but plenty of space Nice airport lounge is very average but better than nothing DXB terminal B for dinner on the way back was fantastic. Very happily fly with them again. Saw staff taking Polaroid's of couples on the 777 from NCE to DXB and then giving them as a gift (I think) - very unusual but thought it was quite a nice touch.,8,20th June 2014,Australia
2087,Emirates has got to be the best value for money for any premium carrier. The pick up from home is excellent they will take you to an airport hotel the night before. Check in was friendly quick and efficient. The lounges in Manchester and Dubai are lovely and peaceful. The food was good and the Wifi works. We will gloss over the Bidvest lounge in Cape Town. The suite has everything you could possibly want. The seat have everything from upright to completely flat. The food was absolutely first class the wines were excellent and the service from the crew was attentive and friendly.,7,18th June 2014,United Kingdom
2088,LAD-DXB-BKK. Flights comfortable and staff very nice. You get up and go to the back for a drink as after the meal they have a staff party and relax. Fair enough. Dubai airport isn't my cup of tea. Duty free cheap and beer expensive. Give me Schipol any day. Good airline. Good entertainment system. Comfortable in economy.,10,18th June 2014,Thailand
2089,Bangkok - Hong Kong First class June 15. Although trip had a rocky start. Emirates lounge closed forced to use Qantas facilities followed by 30 minute delay including horrible boarding experience. Once aboard the 380 all was forgiven. Warm gracious service perfect light meal suitable for the short flight and the wonderful ICE system. First class aboard Emirates is the best.,1,17th June 2014,United States
2090,DXB-ARN on 15 June 2014 on a 777 200 LR. What a wonderful flight service on board was great and a super crew friendly helpful and very professional. 2 hours to landing and during lunch service an announcement for emergency landing was called due to a medical situation. We landed in Moscow and the crew acted very professionally considering the short time notice collected the lunch trays drinks prepared the cabin for landing and ensured the safety of the passengers on board. Almost 2 hours on the ground to finish the emergency landing process and refuel before heading on a short flight to Stockholm. Well done Emirates.,1,17th June 2014,Sweden
2091,Recent trip with Emirates from DUB/DXB/SYD in First. I was going out to Townsville in Northern Queensland for about a week to help my daughter celebrate a big birthday. My wife had travelled out a week in advance of me and returned a week after me. Chauffeur pick up to and from Dublin Airport worked extremely efficiently. Travelling out on 27th May in DUB Emirates use the DAA lounge which is fairly basic with it's services. Hopefully in September when they increase their schedule to two flights each day from DUB they will have their own lounge. The four flights were all in general very good with respect to service comfort etc. The FA on the return from SYD/DXB was absolutely superb. The staff on the final leg from DXB/DUB were not quite up to the general standard shown on the previous flights. I have flown in First with Malaysian Singapore (a lot) and Etihad and I would certainly be happy with the Emirates product.,10,17th June 2014,Ireland
2092,I flew Emirates for the first time return Glasgow to Dubai. My daughter and I were extremely impressed by the comfort of the seats the quality and variety of food and the huge selection of movies etc offered on the IFE. We flew out overnight on 30th May and were looked after by a lovely FA who quite simply could not do enough for us. We arrived early in Dubai and were provided with Fastrack passes for Immigration. I have travelled to Dubai on many occasions (with BA KLM and Air France) and this was the best experience so far. The return (day time) flight was also excellent - again could not fault anything. Another fabulous FA - a young man this time - friendly and helpful. Ground staff in Dubai and Glasgow were courteous and helpful. One minor thing - if Emirates are serious about their commitment to Glasgow Airport they should establish their own lounge. This was the only downside of my experience - they do not have their own lounge in Glasgow - they have space in the ServisAir lounge which has to be one of the most soulless places I have encountered. Very limited choice of drinks no fresh foods at all (only packs of crisps!). Polar opposite is the lounge in Dubai - wonderful is the only word to describe it. It is large airy and offers free WiFi. Hot and cold meals and snacks available in abundance - and Moet and Chandon by the glass! Chauffeur driven cars were provided for both of us for the journeys to and from Glasgow airport (I was travelling from Edinburgh my daughter from Glasgow). Both my drivers were excellent cars were extremely comfortable and on time. I will most certainly be using Emirate again in the future.,8,13th June 2014,United Kingdom
2093,"We flew airbus A380 Manchester-Dubai and returned on the 777. Both planes were excellent and the entertainment system was 2nd to none. I found the seats to be adequate although I have read some concerns about the width we did not find this but both my wife and myself are average height and build at 5 ft 10"". We were however lucky enough on our return journey to have booked just 2 adjoining seats at the rear of the plane which we found really good as there was a bit more room at that point in the aisle as well and we were far enough away from the toilets not to be annoyed by any queue. However my only gripe would be the complimentary drink situation If you are happy to have a drink just when the food is served then its not a problem for you but my wife and myself do like a drink more often than this and class a 7 hour flight with great entertainment almost as one of our nights out (especially on the outward bound flight) Now I don't know what other people would say is over the top but I would quite easily get through 6 or 7 of the little wine bottles they provide in this period of time but found it hard to be served 3. I really did have to keep asking to get any more and on 2 occasions was acknowledged but no wine brought to us. I would have quite happily purchased some at this point but obviously its all complimentary so I couldn't even do this. I have a suspicion that the staff are trained to spot people who may want more alcohol than what they deem to be average consumption and enforce delay tactics to slow you down and felt they were avoiding eye contact with me when passing. They ignored the ""call service"" light on our seat completely and I had to eventually keep getting up and going to the galley where they were. This did spoil the flight to some extent as even when we are on a flight where we have to pay we would have had more than this The food however was again very good.",8,12th June 2014,United Kingdom
2094,Flight ok. SYD to New Zealand flight was late 30 minutes causing us to miss connecting flight. Was unable to get a response from them after 3-4 emails using the Emirates email given to meet the Emirates rep inside the airport. Finally got hold of someone on the phone who said she could not help me. So the flight and carrier were comfortable and pretty polite - unless you end up needing customer service for something. Then it's very difficult to resolve a problem.,8,12th June 2014,United States
2095,Flew Wellington - Sydney - Bangkok return. Having booked with Emirates legs were actually with Qantas (partner airline). This was made clear at booking. However Qantas schedule changed prior to flying which gave a very short connection in Sydney then the Wellington-Sydney plane was late but Qantas air hostess rang through and arranged for a buggy to meet me at the terminal and fast-track me to the gate for the Emirates flight. They closed the gate immediately after I arrived for my flight which I appreciated. However I was seated at the very back of my flight and knowing my predicament no effort was made to help me off the plane first to make my connection. I arrived in Bangkok to discover that though I had made the connection my bag had not and would not come for another 17 hours. The Emirates staff person at Bangkok informed me off this but gave no apology. They promised to deliver the bag to me but as I was two hours out of Bangkok and in a rural area my host had little confidence that a courier would actually make the delivery so we decided to come back to the airport ourselves to collect the bag. Effectively I lost a day and extra money for taxis etc and have still had no apology from the airline. I have flown several times with Emirates and am a member of their skywards programme and this is the first significant complaint normally they are very good.,5,12th June 2014,New Zealand
2096,"LGW-DXB-MNL round trip Economy. Excellent and very efficient Check-in at LGW and very generous 42kg baggage allowance for Skywards Silver. On time Departures and Arrivals for all flights apart from MNL-DXB which was 1.5 hours late in leaving MNL due to ""Immigration Delays"" for 15 passengers. Not Emirates fault as such but I'd have thought the Captain would have had a cut-off time with many more passengers (myself included) having tight onward connections in DXB. In fairness they made up 30 minutes en route. In Dubai passengers with tight connections on late arriving flights are usually gathered together and accompanied through the terminal and allowed to make their connection after the 45-minute cut off period stipulated by Emirates - usually. Cabin Service on all flights was perfectly acceptable but the seats on both the B-777 and A380's are not the best. Food in Economy was of a high standard with plenty of drinks choices. The IFE on Emirates is still amongst the best on any airline and eases the journey considerably. Good value on the ticket price and I'll continue to use Emirates as my first choice.",6,12th June 2014,United Kingdom
2097,Flew BLR-DXB-FCO and IST-DXB-BLR. All flights were B777-300ER. Good seats and excellent ICE entertainment systems. I Had all window seats which we very comfortable and had enough legroom. Food and beverages served were good but took a long time take away the trays. Overall good and satisfactory experience and would surely consider travelling again.,5,10th June 2014,India
2098,London-Dubai-Dhaka and Dhaka-Dubai-London - Business Class. Average service apart from the Dubai to London leg on our way back this was terrible! The cabin crew member who looked after us clearly didn't want to be on the flight she seemed uninterested and tired from the start of the flight. Food wasn't business class standard at all. The sandwich was extremely oily which I didn't like and sent back the replacement - biriyani (main course) was dry followed by sad looking dry sandwiches for afternoon tea and there was no brownie after the sandwiches as the menu stated.,5,10th June 2014,United Kingdom
2099,PER-DXB-SEA and LHR-DXB-PER. I have flown Emirates many times now all these flights were fantastic. Departed and arrived on time service great on all flights and apart from out of Perth all meals were delicious including the best economy meal I have ever eaten on one flight.,10,9th June 2014,Australia
2100,Flight from Heathrow to Dubai very good on the A380 comfort service and entertainment all good. Changing aircraft at Dubai for Perth was appalling. Had to get 2 lifts a 6 minute train ride a 15 minute walk and then an 8 minute bus ride from the gate out to the plane and then a climb up a large flight of steps to the plane. Had no time to use the business class lounge as the transfer gate was so far from where the first leg of the journey arrived. This may have been due to all the construction going on everywhere at the airport. My advice would be to avoid Dubai if possible for at least a year until they are better organised.,7,9th June 2014,United Kingdom
2101,AMS-CPT via DXB. Easy check in at AMS and departure area spacious and good control of boarding. Had rear row to myself so able to stretch out. Transfer at DXB straightforward but does involve a fair amount of walking and a train connection. But well signed. Flight to CPT on B777. Fairly full but comfortable. Staff great as I usually find and very helpful. Special meal provided as ordered. ICE entertainment excellent. Flights arrived on time or within 30 mins of schedule.,9,8th June 2014,South Africa
2102,BEY-DXB-LHR Economy. Emirates continue to set the overall bench mark. Flawless crew and aircraft all on a very well priced ticket. But the food standards have dropped dramatically or should I say the product has somewhat become much cheaper and basic. This is a pity. Food on both sectors was only edible because people were hungry. I note that Alcoholic drinks are kept generally hidden from the public eye to perhaps give the impression that they are not available. The fabulous ICE IFE has somewhat shrunk too. But again they are probably the best overall.,10,8th June 2014,United Kingdom
2103,19th May CHC-SYD-BKK-DXB-LHR 31st May LHR-DXB-BKK-SYD-CHC. On all legs apart from DXB-LHR and LHR-DXB flew on 777-300er and on the DXB legs A380. I have to agree with others who have written about the cramped conditions imposed by the use of 3x4x3 cabin layout and the impact it has on both passenger comfort and cabin crew mobility. Of the two aircraft's I flew on I found the window seat most comfortable on the 777-300er curvature of the aircraft body interior on the A380 ate into what little legroom there was. The cabin crew for the most part was professional and good at their job however on the flight from DXB-LHR there was an issue regarding careless parents and a wilful toddler intent on roaming the aisle and not strapped in as we prepared for take off which an obviously inexperienced FA did not have the confidence to deal with. I found all food offered and on such a long series of flights there was a lot of food offered to be acceptable not amazing but acceptable and the drinks service adequate. If I asked for anything it was brought promptly and with good grace. On my return journey I had a crashing headache and had nothing to take for it in my carry-on. When asking if there was anything onboard for a headache a FA swiftly brought me two Panadol and a glass of water for which I was most grateful. I was pleasantly surprised by the hotel used for my Dubai Connect transit stop. I was taken to the Arabian Park hotel and having read some of the horror stories about the Copthorne I was pleased with my allocation. However it was not easy or clear where I was to go to at DXB to avail of the Dubai Connect offer as there is no signage for it specifically and it was trial and error that found it and not due to any help from staff at DXB. If I have any complaints at all about my flights they are mostly about some of my fellow passengers who seemed to go out of their way to make the rest of us uncomfortable and the irrational 3x4x3 cabin layouts. One of these things Emirates can change the other they can't. My final thoughts about my flights are this and one concerns the blatant disregard many of my fellow passengers had for the carry on baggage protocols. The lack of enforcement regarding carry on quotas results in overhead bins being so stuffed that some of us had no space to stow baggage of legitimate size and quantity anywhere near our seats. The other being the reliance of the IFE system to divert us from the cramped cabin conditions. Let's face it no movie is going to stop FAs bumping passengers in aisle seats or avert the ridiculous situation of a 3x4x3 cabin layout.,5,5th June 2014,New Zealand
2104,EK418 BKK-CHC via SYD. Fantastic as usual. Comfortable 777-300ER no issues at all. Crew were superb all the way food was exceptional and the alcohol flowed freely. ICE movies and music exceptional. Arrived on time into SYD and early into CHC. Emirates really are up there with the best of them.,4,5th June 2014,New Zealand
2105,I took flight EK405 from Melbourne to Singapore. My Flight was at 1800 and it departed on time. The cabin crew were very helpful and its customer service was great. The personal television was big and there was a great choice of movies. The cabin lighting was great too. I took the B777-300ER and the seating arrangement was 3-4-3. It was rather cramped but the overall experience was great and I would recommend and definitely take Emirates again.,5,5th June 2014,Singapore
2106,CHC-BKK via SYD codeshare with QF. Departed Christchurch on QF138 737-800 plane full service ok food quality ok and served with a smile. Unfortunately we were seated right down the back by the toilet so after breakfast people queued beside us to use. Landed in Sydney then transferred to QF A330 to BKK. Old plane broken seat great crew made up for it. I don't understand why Emirates has joined up with Qantas the Emirates experience is far superior to what Qantas can offer.,10,5th June 2014,New Zealand
2107,I flew on 777s from Sydney to Bangkok to Dubai to Geneva. Nice food and good entertainment. The first two legs were full planes and the service suffered because of it. The staff were pretty scarce for much of these flights but they were responsive if you managed to get their attention. I thought it a bit unprofessional that they were often chatting and laughing at the back of the plane while the poor people sitting back there tried to sleep. On the last leg the plane was only half full and the service much better. But at least 20 screens weren't working at all - luckily there were lots of other empty seats to move to.,9,5th June 2014,Australia
2108,LHR-DXB-LHR. First flight on the Emirates A380. Compared to B777 seats were wider but legroom felt the same. Flight was quieter and smoother than B777. Check in in LHR was good with no queuing and friendly staff. Check-in in DXB no so good 20 minute queue with certain locals known to Airline staff being allowed to jump queue. Check in agent did not smile once. Boarding on both flights very efficient with no queuing or crowding on aircraft or airbridge. Service on outbound flight no so good no drinks served until after meal only one trolley drink service and no breakfast or food before early morning 6.30am arrival. Long wait for trays to be collected. Service on return better with drinks service before and after meal and light afternoon staff. Again long wait for trays to be cleared. Adequate number of toilets on flights with no significant queuing. In flight entertainment superb with good quality screen let down by poor control sensitivity.,10,4th June 2014,United Kingdom
2109,"LHR-DXB-LHR with Emirates both ways on A380. Aircraft is truly fantastic as we were heading away for a last minute holiday with our son we plumped for economy rather than business which we would usually go for if we had booked further in advance however the comfort of the economy seats on the A380 is superb and fine for 6.5 hours each way. Managed 4 hours sleep on both flights which is something of a rarity for me too. Unfortunately as I've always found with Emirates seemingly irrespective of class booked the cabin crew were absolutely terrible from start to finish on both flights. Bless them they look great in their smart uniforms and clearly only better looking examples are chosen to wear it. Sadly this comes with a built in 'chip on the shoulder' which I've seen on every Emirates flight (more than thirty) which I've taken over the past decade or so. Slow surly service was the order of the day on both sectors. On the outbound flight more than two hours after departure for a meal which for a flight departing at 2040 was very disappointing as it minimised sleep opportunities. Food nice and plenty of it. A request for a second glass of wine was met by a retort from a French stewardess: ""I have more than 500 passenger today so I get it when I can"". I replied that as she had 23 colleagues on board she needed only to worry about 21 passengers and had nearly seven hours in which to do it. Needless to say my wine was forgotten and I helped myself from the galley instead. Another member of cabin staff ignored my son completely even though he is more than capable of asking for his own drinks. On the way home a two hour ground delay due to passenger illness before departure was handled by the service of half full glasses of water only. Not impressive. Sad really because the aircraft and the product is very good. Just delivered very poorly. My airline of choice is BA.",4,4th June 2014,United Kingdom
2110,We travelled from Heathrow-Dubai-Cape Town. The aircraft was a 777 all sectors this airline has to be the most uncomfortable and over rated. The seats were crammed in 3x4x3 so narrow and with narrow aisles to. The whole experience was exhausting. The staff were indifferent and you could tell they couldn't wait to get off and avoid the suffering stares from the trussed up passengers. I would suggest think long and hard before booking if the aircraft is a 777. I understand most airlines had 3x3x3 set up which is civilised. Food was ok TV ok and all on time. Transfer at Dubai ok nothing special though.,9,2nd June 2014,United Kingdom
2111,LHR-DXB-HKT. Codeshare with Qantas on way out for first leg of the journey. Emirates for the 2nd keg and both sectors for the return. Very nice and able to use BA Business lounge at LHR. Had an excellent vegetable curry before the flight. Arrived at Dubai and followed signs for gate and Business lounge only to be told we were at the terminal. Signage was poor and quite a few other people made the same mistake. Phuket airport was confusing as the terminal is not well signed. Again business class so whisked through security and passport control so no need to queue. Coral Lounge at Phuket is very small and serves First and Business class it is also a lounge were you can pay to enter. NO wines or spirits are on offer was told to go outside and buy wine if I wanted it. The toilets are also a few minutes walk away from the lounge. Dubai again on way back and was told the gate was B16 (the terminal we were at). Luckily I noticed on the departure board that it had changed to A13. No announcement so not sure if anyone missed the flight as it entailed another shuttle train to B gates. New A380 plane and was very nice food etc all good as were the staff.,10,1st June 2014,United Kingdom
2112,EK751 Dubai to Casablanca on May 8th 2014. Using miles to upgrade from business to first class on a recent Dubai to Casablanca flight I was beyond disappointed in the product and the experience from what I had considered a world class airline eager to stand out amongst its strong rivals like Etihad or Qatar Airways. Not only was the cabin crew service rude and sporadic the inflight entertainment system was faulty the first class catering was not offered and the headsets were defective. And when all this was reported to customer service there was a very passive response to the feedback. This airline was once a star but it is definitely falling from grace.,9,1st June 2014,United Arab Emirates
2113,Flight EK 421 Perth to Dubai 6th May 2014. I have flown the Glasgow to Perth via Dubai route several times however this was by far the worst experience economy was full and as anyone that has flown on the Emirates 700-300 will know due to the 3x4x3 seat configuration how cramped this can be. For long periods of time sometimes up to an hour despite there not being turbulence the seat belt sign was kept on so people couldn't go to the bathroom despite cabin crew walking around freely resulting in long queues when the sign was turned off. It made for an uncomfortable 10.5 hour flight. Connecting flight to Glasgow was okay.,8,28th May 2014,United Kingdom
2114,My flights were EK16 LGW-DXB 26 May 2014 connecting EK384 DXB-BKK 27 May 2014. Ground staff both at Gatwick and Dubai were polite and friendly. Very quick and smooth checking in and boarding. Both flights were on time. Cabin crews were definitely helpful smiley and attentive. F&B were quite nice. I chose yoghurt chicken curry with rice from Gatwick and Chicken Congee from Dubai. Toilets and cabin were kept clean. Inflight entertainment with live news so many choices of movies TV shows games and music. Large individual screen though. My headset from EK384 DXB-BKK wasn't working but I got another one which was fine. It was my first time flying with EK and I must say everything was beyond my expectation. I'm absolutely impressed by their excellent services. Much better than Etihad's. Worth every penny. Highly recommended.,10,27th May 2014,United Kingdom
2115,HAM-DXB: Check-In Staff at HAM extremely rude. I had a long discuss about the weight of my handbag. EK allows strictly only 7 kg. handbag incl. Cameras Laptop reading materials umbrella. As per IATA rule those carry-on personal items can be carried free of charges into the cabin without weighing and counting to the handbag but not by EK. HAM-DXB on EK 62 (B777) late evening flight took off at 21.25 Hrs. Very cramped seats and very slow service I got my dinner served at 23.30 hrs 2 hours after take-off. After 5 hours transit at DXB airport for onward flight to BKK with EK 372 (A380). After boarding we were informed about the 2 hours delay but we were not allowed to get off the aircraft so had to sit in the full A380 (fortunately seats are more comfortable than B777) with no drink or meal service. During the delay crews were hidden and enjoyed talking with themselves in the galleys. After taking off with a 2 hours delay crews still needed another 2.5 hours before starting to serve meals to hungry passengers. Quality and quantity of food was poor. Only 1 drink was served 1 hour later. After 2 hours trays were collected with the offering of tea or coffee. Poor cleanliness during the flight toilets were not cleaned or controlled. I notified the crew that one toilet had run out of tissue but nothing happened.,3,27th May 2014,Germany
2116,My spouse and I flew first class Christchurch-Sydney-Dubai-Frankfurt 16 November 2013. Our second flight on our return itinerary (outward from Frankfurt to Christchurch was also with Emirates in Business Class) Sydney to Dubai was cancelled due to a rainstorm at Sydney airport which meant we had to deplane after approx three hours on board and spend all night in Sydney airport waiting for our luggage to be returned and then re-queue to be re-booked on a new flight. It was an A380 so there were hundreds of people involved yet almost no Emirates Staff available or information provided. At re-check-in we asked to be re-routed to Paris rather than Frankfurt as we realised that the new routing to Frankfurt meant we would not be able to reach Brussels - our final destination by train connection the same day and so would have to stay in a hotel overnight in Germany. We made repeated requests to be re-routed and we knew there was availability in the first class cabin on the Paris flight. Yet despite all our requests nobody seemed prepared to understand our predicament or accede to our request. We also noticed that the level of service – nd attitudes of staff - differed substantially across flights. While some were outstanding such as the First Class leg from Christchurch to Sydney (probably because we were the only people in the first class cabin) service on other legs was sometimes surly and when our problems arose on the return leg we had the impression that staff were more interested in keeping us quiet and fobbing us off than sincerely wanting to help resolve our travel dilemma. For example the Senior Purser onboard suggested we use their on-board WiFi and telephone service to enquire about being re-scheduled onto the Paris flight as it was “not very expensive” - I later discovered a €50 charge on my credit card statement! Upon landing in Dubai we enquired with ground staff about changing to the later flight to Paris but Dubai ground staff shouted at us that we were obliged to take the Frankfurt flight as our luggage had already been checked through to Frankfurt and that we would have to pay penalties for changing our routing. So all in all we have at best mixed feelings about our Emirates Experience in-flight given what was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime in First Class but definitely disappointed at their mediocre response to a fairly simple request to be re-routed and lack of customer care afterwards. All-in-all we probably will not be travelling with Emirates again.,5,26th May 2014,Belgium
2117,BKK-LGW-BKK. The aircraft are fairly new and in good shape as you'd expect. The service is very hit and miss mostly a miss. On one leg shortly after takeoff the crew distributed promising looking menu cards but this was just a tease since no food materialised until almost 5 hours into a 6 hour flight. The purser spent the flight in and out of the understair workstation adjacent to my seat on the A380 slamming the door each time. When the food did arrive it was poor. On another leg the food was served in the first couple of hours and was very enjoyable being salmon and mashed potatoes. They seemed quite happy to bring the odd glass of wine throughout all the flights. On one leg we were bussed to the aircraft at Dubai which was strangely parked in a very remote part of the airfield. All those gates at Dubai and we end up having a 20 minute bus ride and climbing steps to the aircraft. The customer service at Gatwick was very poor. Although the ground staff had all week to advise me of a requirement regarding my return flight (I visited their desk on several occasions) they failed to do so and waited until I arrived at check in with all my bags and then turned me away. If you have cause to contact Emirates with a complaint after you've flown they seem to be very reluctant to provide email addresses or forms for this purpose.,8,26th May 2014,Spain
2118,Flight from Perth (Australia) to Dubai did not meet expectations. Despite the airlines supposed reputation the food quality and choice was very poor. The touchscreen was insensitive and caused considerable frustration when trying to select particular films or music. Most notable the staff were surly and generally unhelpful. This was one of the worst flights I have ever endured !,8,23rd May 2014,United Kingdom
2119,Colombo to Amsterdam via Dubai and Paris to Colombo via Dubai. Food was fantastic excellent inflight entertainment. Staff very attentive will use Emirates again. Flew in A380 as well.,3,23rd May 2014,Sri Lanka
2120,Lisbon to Luanda via Dubai. In the past I used TAP Portugal to go Luanda but due to delays high fares old aircraft and poor service I changed. Emirates is a cut above the rest flights were on-time main leg on way out was on a modern 777 very nice and more space than competition food was delicious crew professional and helpful. I can't remember any other carrier proactively offering so many drinks and refills in economy class.,10,21st May 2014,Portugal
2121,BKK-DXB-FRA-DUS-DXB-BKK . Limousine chauffeur on time Qantas lounge in BKK as Emirates under renovation excellent day flight to Frankfurt no amenities but its a day flight so no problem good choices of entertainment. on my return I pampered myself in First amazing service and I had the best sleep of my life up in the air. excellent food and wine list. Crew as usual very helpful and nice.,5,20th May 2014,Thailand
2122,CPT-DXB Boeing 777-300. Comfortable flight friendly and efficient cabin crew. Lunch & dinner serving outstanding. Staff made the flight as pleasant as possible. ICE inflight entertainment system with excellent choices.,7,20th May 2014,United Arab Emirates
2123,PER-DXB-HAM. My first experience with Emirates Business Class. Started very well with the Chauffeur car. Staff at check in good. Lounge nicely presented. IFE in my seat did not work. Luckily seat next to me vacant. Impressive looking seat was surprisingly narrow and no elbow room. Found it hard to get comfortable. No amenity pack offered on either sector all the way to Hamburg. Found it very difficult to choose something I wanted to eat. Food too middle eastern with no choice offered friendly crew. Lounge in Dubai awful. Probably the worst I've had for a while. Far too overcrowded. HAM-DXB-PER: Chauffeur pick up lounge nice but hard to find. Much better flight than outbound. Same issue with food although this time I ate in the lounge where the food had more of a western flavour to it. Staff friendly and helpful. Different seat with better elbow room. IFE is a little awkward to use. My bag was damaged on arrival in Perth. The baggage services team in Perth were very helpful and my bag was replaced. As a Qantas frequent flyer this was a rewards trip so I'm not too devastated by the experience. If I had to spend full price on a business class fare I would probably look elsewhere. The lounge in Dubai and the seats being the major turn offs.,8,19th May 2014,Australia
2124,CPT to LHR via DXB in economy. Two full planes Boeing 777 and A380. Staff excellent helpful and pleasant. Both arrived early or on time. Boarding done by row numbers and well controlled. Seating on 777 narrower but I found more comfortable than the A380. Entertainment vast and varied. Food ok. But why do airlines still insist on providing hot breakfasts in the very early hours which are so unappetising. My poached eggs could have survived a set at Wimbledon! And three hours before landing at 4am when I had just got off to sleep - surely no need. I can't believe passengers want this - a light and healthy snack 90 mins before landing would be more preferable. Going for fruit platter meals in future. Off loaded at LHR quickly and despite a busy terminal through immigration and customs within 30mins of landing.,8,18th May 2014,South Africa
2125,MAD-DXB-BKK Business Class (Frequent Flyer Gold Card holder) traveling approximately bi-monthly for over two years. I've noticed a marked deterioration in quality on this service and my last two flights have had problems which need bringing to the attention of a wider audience. I note from comments on this site that others have noted a similar deterioration in service on Emirates. On the first flight I was double charged by the airline. When I pointed this out to the Service Center I was initially told I was incorrect. After a second e-mail and a delay I was informed by another individual I had to prove that I had been overcharged. When I did this I was then told by a third employee to enter certain information via the web to obtain a refund. I tried several times but the information was clearly wrong. After a further delay a fourth employee suggested I was entering the data incorrectly. I tried again: same result. I then asked the matter to be escalated. No reply. Eventually after further e-mails a fifth employee agreed that the matter should be escalated. Over a month later I received an incomplete refund and a lame excuse for an apology. On my last flight EK385 the service was awful. My breakfast was initially not delivered. After trying to attract the attention of staff my meal some 45 minutes late was slammed down; it was as might be expected after being allowed to stew for that amount of time inedible. After asking for the Purser a 'Senior' eventually arrived who tried various displacement techniques to avoid apologising. I eventually forced an apology and was asked if I wanted 'something' (unspecified) to replace the disgusting plate. By this time the plane was descending. I asked again to see the Purser who eventually turned up and mumbled on about 'the girl' who was responsible. She disappeared to make the safety announcement prior to landing and I never saw her again. I have received no recompense. I would suggest that if you experience problems on Emirates don't expect prompt service genuine apologies or any recompense. You will have to deal with an obstructive Service Center staffed by arrogant and essentially incompetent individuals and an on board 'crew' who regard themselves as a superior class of persons who unless you are prepared to ingratiate yourself find providing a service beneath them. As there is ample choice of airlines on this route I certainly wont fly Emirates again and would advise caution if anyone is considering it as the alternatives which I have recently sampled are infinitely superior.,7,18th May 2014,Spain
2126,"SYD-AKL-SYD and SYD-AKL-SYD my work booked these flights. To say the staff are rude is an understatement. Onboard staff were only interested in quickly serving the meals and you didn't even have time to finish eating off your tray before they whipped them away. Any rubbish left over they weren't interested in picking up with their precious little fingers. I buzzed for duty free for an hour and asked 3 people if I could buy some and kept getting told ""I'll tell the girl I'll tell the girl"" or ""she should be coming through"" only to find that ""she"" couldn't be bothered. Ground staff at both airports were rude and I was looked down on (it felt) for a being a Qantas business customer. Rude arrogant staff.",10,17th May 2014,Australia
2127,LHR-Auckland- LHR via Dubai April/May 2014 in A380. I thought the comfort of the A380 economy seats was better than other planes entertainment fantastic service good. The food wasn't always to my taste but that is my problem. All legs of the journey were on time would recommend.,9,17th May 2014,United Kingdom
2128,BNE to FRA via DXB. Staff pleasant helpful and enthusiastic. Aircraft clean and looks modern and well maintained. Well stocked personal minibar. Punctual. Great food IFE is fantastic. I've done four flights with Emirates and will continue to fly with them. Pity they don't do transPacific flights to US/Canada.,4,17th May 2014,Australia
2129,ARN-AKL via DXB and SYD in Business. Very comfortable lounge in ARN. Clean aircraft ARN-DXB with attentive and pleasant FAs but come across as a bit inexperienced. Slow drink service during dinner and food ok but not great. The Business seat a bit cramped for my taste. Had the Dubai connect service at DXB (because of a long lay-over the airline puts you up in a hotel arranges transport and visa for you) and that was great. Nice to have a good bed for the night in an excellent hotel. Immigration into and out of Dubai very quick. Lounge in DXB was excellent (have a hard time understanding all the negative reviews about this - but admittedly did not use washrooms or showers. Food was great). Flight from DXB to AKL via SYD in 380. Excellent seat. Again very pleasant FAs but again somewhat inexperienced appearing. Again very slow drink service. Was given a before dinner drink. Then no drink with the starter but with the assurance that it was coming. It came when the starter was finished. Then the main meal arrived but no drink. That came after the meal was finished. Those things are not the end of the world but it comes across as somewhat unprofessional. Lounge in SYD was fine with nice shower and flight from SYD to AKL had a new crew that seemed more experienced. Overall though I was pleased especially considering the cost was significantly lower than on competing airlines. So in spite of missing out on a glass of wine or two I will do this again.,8,16th May 2014,New Zealand
2130,Auckland/Dubai/LHR economy connecting flight EK 1 to LHR delayed at Dubai for over 1hr but no explanation given by ground staff in fact appeared unprofessional not until on the aircraft did you get an adequate response from the captain who gave a full explanation. By coincidence my leg from Heathrow to Dubai was also delayed exactly 2 weeks earlier so wonder if they have a scheduling problem. The A380 is a huge aircraft and with its size comes big logistics the cabin crew were not particularly attentive and water for such a long flight was offered very infrequently and the service was not anywhere near the service I had been given by Asiana Airlines to Auckland a year earlier.,7,15th May 2014,United Kingdom
2131,I travelled from Manchester to Hong Kong via Dubai. All flights were on-time the aircraft were modern clean and the food was good. The crew were professional friendly and helpful.,6,13th May 2014,United Kingdom
2132,Auckland-Melbourne-Auckland. Both flights on time. Food and service excellent. Like the bar at the back of the A380. Small problem with seat on the return leg soon fixed by moving to other seats.,3,11th May 2014,New Zealand
2133,Dubai - Male 22nd February 2014 Flight EK0652. On the morning of 22nd February we boarded the flight in Dubai at the correct time despite their being some fog in which cleared by approximately 10.30am. We were held on the plane for over 7.5 hours and then had our flight cancelled and were disembarked. Told that once we left the plane an Emirates attendant would be waiting to show us where to go. After we left the plane we went through the airport doors to be offered two options 'arrivals' or 'transfers' and no-one had any idea where to go and no help was available. We saw a few Emirates staff around and when we went to them asking for assistance they just shrugged their shoulders and said we had to queue up at the desk. We queued for 2 hours and when we finally got to the front we were told that no information was available and that we had to come back in 20 minutes! We asked about hotel accommodation and was told that all hotels were booked. The lack of communication was terrible no announcements made no apologies. Finally after an exhaustive night and at about 4am Sunday we were told that everyone would not be able to fly until Monday. This debacle carried on until about 5.30am when we were told that we were going to fly after all at 11am Sunday. The journey took approximately 42 hours which should have been a four hour flight. The absolute worst part was having absolutely no information forthcoming - it was an absolute disgrace.,10,11th May 2014,United Kingdom
2134,We were disappointed by the standard of the flight from Male to Dubai. The plane was old old entertainment system (not very responsive and outdated quality also the Arabic subtitles in large size could not be switched off) and all interior a bit worn off. One would not expect it with this airline. Food was mediocre at best and the preferred choice was gone before our row was served. Drinks (non alcoholic and alcoholic) were all fine though. Toilets: Two toilets out of soap relatively soon after the start of the flight. Not great also in terms of cleanliness. Floor: Worn off but mainly disturbing because staff did not collect / pic up plastic debris fallen on the floor during the flight. Main ground for disappointment was the broken tray (46G) preventing you from eating (nothing could be put on the tray without falling / sliding off). Staff apologised but in the end though they were friendly that does not take away the inconvenience and as the flight was full (at least in econ.) a change of seat was no option.,1,11th May 2014,Germany
2135,This airline was not at all child friendly and we had many problems. The transit in Dubai involved a bus trip over 30 minutes long standing in a hot stuffy bus. Some of our kids were given activity packs on the aircraft and some were not. The allergy meals although not containing the specified allergen contained many other common allergens such as eggs fish and seafood. The meat for these meals was always fish. We did not receive the diabetic meal we ordered on every flight. Staff on the A380's are immature and more concerned with enjoying the trip themselves and their own comfort. No drinks were offered between meals on the return A380 flight. The crew spent their time gossiping in the service areas. Our flight on the return trip was changed and we weren't notified until we tried to check in. These are just some of the highlights but overall the experience was very stressful.,4,11th May 2014,Sweden
2136,"VIE-DXB after taking off the bassinet on the wall was installed quickly amenity kit distributed and even blankets with collectible monsters. When I asked the crew to fill up our babybottle with hot water this was done in less than 10 minutes. DXB-MNL the crew seemed very tired and unmotivated. I am just wondering why the ""sparkle"" of the crew was missing? Even at the flight back the crew was so-so at the first leg but at the second leg they tried their best. Emirates takes good care of their passengers food service excellent ground handling (handled by Austrian Airlines in Vienna) was great as the Supervisor blocked the seat next to us so we could rest better and I think its a big plus for Emirates that they lend Strollers in DXB to families.",9,11th May 2014,Austria
2137,DXB-ARN-DXB. Biz class return In short both these flights were of a high calibre especially the return leg on the 08/05 ARN-DXB the Purser was an English lady who is a total asset to the airline. Her manner with passengers was professional yet friendly and she and her team gave an excellent service. Both legs service was top notch flights on time and arrived early. ICE as usual had the latest movies and seat comfort superb. My only small gripe again is the food Biriyani in Biz class is not acceptable  I chose the Veal which was chewy and tough and had to return it. Wines were good. Failing that a great set of flights!,1,11th May 2014,United Arab Emirates
2138,I went from Dusseldorf to Singapore and back with Emirates. The service was great! One thing I really liked was that the cabin crew members were very open towards me. They weren't treating me like a customer but like a friend. The food was excellent as well and the seats were provided with TV's. There were lots of films and music to pick. The cabin crew also provided us with blankets before we started flying. This was excellent since I wanted to sleep immediately. To be honest I can't really say anything bad about Emirates. Great airline.,7,11th May 2014,Netherlands
2139,London Gatwick - Dubai EK016 1/5/2014. Dubai - Kuala Lumpur EK346 2/5/2014. I have been using Emirates for several years and have found little to grumble with until recently. I have flown primarily between the UK and Far East transiting via Dubai. Fares have generally been cheap and the service and food has been passable. I was upgraded to Business class on a couple of occasions but really wouldn't rate it as being much better than Economy class. I flew with them in Jan/Feb 2014 and again on this current trip May 2014. I would have to say and in line with most other reviewers the service has gone downhill dramatically. Boarding the plane was organised and orderly in London Gatwick but quite haphazard and chaotic in Dubai. On both flights food seemed to be served in a chaotic manner. The stewardesses appeared to be a mixture of Qantas and Emirates staff and were often at odds with what each other was doing. They appeared quite stressed at times and were curt rather than polite with inquiries. Emirates staff have never been as polished or professional as MAS staff and from my observations a certain level of rudeness/frustration has crept in and is very noticeable at times. One of my biggest bug bears is that they no longer ask passengers to right their seats to enable people to eat their food in comfort. I quite often end up eating in an impossibly restricted space. Asking a Stewardess for assistance to rectify this is not always responded to positively. The choice of food doesn't seem to have changed for years and has become boring if not unpalatable at times. Travelling in Economy is no longer a pleasure and the term cattle class feels more apt these days. I stopped using Malaysia Airlines years ago because of the cost of their flights and poor service at that time. When I started using Emirates I began recommending it to all my friends because of the level of service and affordable fares. I probably will continue to use Emirates but would consider other options such as MAS Qatar Etihad and Turkish Airlines all of which appear to be doing well in the ratings. I certainly would have misgivings about recommending Emirates to friends at present.,3,10th May 2014,United Kingdom
2140,LGW-AKL in First A380 all the way. As usual an extremely good product extremely well delivered. Pricing out of LGW was more competitive than via LHR which is nearer my home but the included chauffeur service meant the added distance and time were negligible. The lounge at LGW despite being under renovation still served top-class food (as do most EK lounges worldwide) with an impressive Margaux to sip. Staff were very courteous. All sectors (LGW- DXB DXB-SYD and SYD-AKL) were excellent - slept reasonably well superb selection of modern films on the IFE high quality cabin crew. The shower spa is a fantastic luxury that I continue to thoroughly enjoy every time I use it - it's a real boon on such a long flight to be able to shower at the time you want to help adjust your body clock for your arrival. I'm not a fan of the First Class lounge in the A380 terminal at DXB it feels completely soulless and the shower was only lukewarm - the second time I've experienced this. The massage in the spa was good though. Return AKL-LGW was almost as good as the outbound. However the menu was limited and repetitive - lamb and chicken biryani on all sectors. Although there was also a pasta dish this was not really the level of variety and quality I expect when flying in First for more than 24 hours. Thankfully a bit of creative thinking with the starters (including the excellent mezze and generous portions of caviar) meant I was certainly not going to be left hungry. Simple things like freshly-prepared toast are also very welcome though I wish they would introduce ice cream. One slight niggle is that I asked for a large bottle of water when I boarded and was told there only 6 for the entire flight so I couldn't have one moments later another member of cabin crew came up and offered one oblivious to what I'd previously been told. Overall though cabin crew were even better on the return leg especially between Brisbane and Dubai. Boarding for the final sector B777 DXB to LGW was a farce and the one real let-down of the trip. I was called from the lounge at 0710 for an 0800 flight then had to wait for thirty minutes in two different holding areas until they could bring a special bus for the first class pax (frankly I'd rather have just got on a normal bus and been able to relax on the aircraft) which then took more than 15 minutes to crawl around the airfield. All in all though Emirates First continues to be by far my preferred carrier to New Zealand for its mix of quality service and cost.,3,10th May 2014,United Kingdom
2141,DUS-SIN-DUS. Again full score for Emirates! It's simply the best. Perfect friendly and attentive crew very good meals no delays wonderful inflight entertainment. Recommend to use also the free Chauffeur service to make it even more convenient.,9,10th May 2014,Germany
2142,Been travelling Emirates for a year and on 3 occasions (all from London to Kuala Lumpur). Overall experiences have been good except for our recent flight last week. As before we booked our seats online but one of the seat was changed without our knowledge leading us having to re-booked/changed both our seats to one which we are unhappy with. Check in staff on the day was unhelpful. We will be flying again early June to Kuala Lumpur but will give Emirates a miss on this occasion as the protest. We will consider Emirates again next year.,8,8th May 2014,United Kingdom
2143,ATH-DXB-ATH. Arriving at check-in flight was overbooked in economy. They offered me an upgrade to business at 300 euros per sector. During booking business class price was 1300 euros so I stayed with J. An A345 the seat was comfortable and pitch just ok. Catering ok but really nothing special. Crew very attentive IFE the typical ICE on EK which is not my taste. Variety of movies limited. Flight arrived on time. Return a different story. Again overbooked flight and the same offer. Still on J class on a 777-300. Boarding and a bus ride that literally took 37 minutes. Nice tour of the airport! Flight departed with 30 minutes delay due to the bus ride as we got into the plane 5 minutes before the STD. Same thing on catering and seat. This time crew was a bit uninterested and robotic. Arriving in ATH and we have to wait for our bags more than 25 minutes. All in all an average experience. Next time and my schedule permits I will try Etihad or Qatar as their ticket price is a bit lower and inflight service seems to be better than EK.,9,7th May 2014,Greece
2144,EK 413 AKL-SYD 13 April Business Class. Disappointing service and poor hospitality. Emirates appear to have lost their former sparkle. Problems started at the Emirates Lounge in AKL where numerous Qantas passengers were denied entry due to different rules applying to status levels and guests. Emirates staff looked particularly anguished dealing with the number of complaints they had on this occasion. The Lounge was full to capacity and it was difficult to find a seat with flights going via Brisbane Sydney and Melbourne all around the same time. However the food in the lounge is exceptionally good compared to competitor offerings at the moment. Onboard the business class standard on the A380 was poor in hospitality comparison to current competitors. Young inexperienced staff surprisingly lacking basic etiquette and manners. Staff looked tired and despondent. During the flight I was either served twice or not at all. Despite the new A380 I was surrounded with broken and depreciated equipment. Meal service very average. The staff just seemed to want to rush and close down the service as quickly as possible. The pricing is definitely competitive and if hospitality isn't important and you just want to nod off this could still be a good way to travel. For me the quality is just not good enough in hospitality for business class. Its not just about the IFE and the swish seating capsule. The outbound flight with Air New Zealand may have lacked the latest technology and wizardry in cabin design but made up for it in spades in terms of hospitality professionalism and overall comfort. Have used Emirates a couple of times over the last few years and couldn't fault them previously. Will avoid them for a while. Clearly lost something as I didn't feel looked after on this occasion.,9,5th May 2014,Australia
2145,Birmingham-Dubai-Bangkok-Sydney-Christchurch NZ 19 January 2014. Economy. Nice food and good service. Birmingham - Dubai was a 777 (2 class) and we had bassinet bulkhead seats row 8 which gave lots of legroom. Dubai - Bangkok was the A380 which is super comfortable we had bulkhead behind seats next to the midships galley. There was some noise from the galley and there is a locker above the seats which is not great but we were comfortable enough. Bangkok - Sydney was with Qantas this was the least comfortable as plane was older. Although Emirates is Qantas partner you cannot pre-assign seats for Qantas flights so these were our least good seats. Sydney to Christchurch was again a 777 and not full so I again sat in row 8. I believe that Emirates does not make the (777 2 class) row 8 bassinet seats available until airport check in. If there are no babies needing them you can ask at the gate to move into these seats and if you are a frequent flyer you may get moved It worked for us.,7,5th May 2014,United Kingdom
2146,EK 418 - QF 8418 - Bangkok - Sydney. Seats - 17A 17B 17D 17E 17F + Bassinet for baby. 24/04/2014. When I saw I was Emirates coming back from Bangkok I was very happy as I had heard great things about them. In the end it was a disaster. Couldn't check in all the way through with my family at Phuket so had to wait until a desk opened in Bangkok then best part of 45 mins. Once on the aircraft we had been split up so cabin crew tried to sort this out but a very large person who had booked the seat insisted having it. It was sorted in the end but took a long time. As for the seats they where like rocks to sit on for any time. I was amazed that the cabins have large screen that keep coming on and off telling us here we are. One was directly over my 5 month old Granddaughter and every time it came on it woke her up. Even with the eye shades provided for passengers the bright light came through making it impossible to rest or sleep. Over all very disappointed.,8,5th May 2014,New Zealand
2147,Emirates had become my airline of choice because of the great seats and entertainment system on their new A380's. Until my most recent flights I also found their service and food to be among the best. However on my recent flights from HKG to DXB and DXB to Dublin I found both the food and service to be awful. Their switch to serving food in J class on open plates is a disaster. The food ends up lukewarm and dry. I much preferred the sealed container. The food was bland and tasteless. The cabin attendants on both sectors were pretty indifferent. On the second sector service was particularly clueless with wrong orders and lack of apology. I might just look for other options next time I fly. One thing also to bear in mind if you can avoid it - the HKG-DXB route flies over Bay of Bengal. Turbulence here as on my flight can be fairly rough during monsoon season. Also for some reason we had to be bussed to the gate when we reached DXB. The ground journey took 20 minutes. The place where we were dropped off happened to be the confluence between T1 and T3 and as a result a lot of transit passengers headed off in the wrong direction. A frustrating mistake to make at midnight when you are already tired.,1,5th May 2014,Hong Kong
2148,"On a recent flight on 22 April from Warsaw to Guangzhou via Dubai (EK180) I was upgraded to Business Class. Finally I get to sample the much advertised Emirates Business Class. The Business Class was full and so was the entire flight I assume. The welcome was the usual that you get with the welcome drink but none of the staff offered to take my jacket. After take off the bar service started quite late. There was a wait of approximately 40 minutes. The second round of drinks took ages. I had ordered a second whisky which the staff conveniently forgot. I had to remind to which I was given a curt unapologetic ""it's being made""! That too by the chief purser a lady in her 50's. During the meal which was nice the wine came only once. I had to remind the stewardess to fill-up my long empty glass. The staff was not well-informed about the plane either. I asked one if it was the new 777 to which she replied that she did not know. She never bothered to find-out and inform either. I can say one thing about Emirates. The hardware is there but the 'software' still needs to be updated. Staff training on customer satisfaction has to be intensified. I would not recommend anyone to buy the Business Class unless it's only for the additional comfort. Service is definitely lacking. Wonder what the First Class is like. Taking into account my experience in the Business Class I am certain the pampering is non-existent. Frankly I prefer Lufthansa. The service in all classes is very good and that keeps you aching for more.",2,4th May 2014,Poland
2149,Flew from Zurich to Tokyo via Dubai. The flight was efficiently handled. B777 on the way out was fine though the seating was not better than normal. A380 from DXB to ZRH had noticeably more seat space and was remarkably quiet. Meals were exceptionally good but service was patchy. Not everyone got coffee maybe the team needs to bring in some f/b to improve there.,10,4th May 2014,Switzerland
2150,Flight EK050/EK705 in Economy Flight EK706/EK051 in Business. Used special EK offer for business class. From MUC to DXB and back A380: comfortable seats with enough leg room even in Economy! DXB to SEZ a very different story: A340-500 with really cramped seating in Economy seats in Business on SEZ to DXB are not lie-flat and not comfortable. Food ok on 3 legs but worse (with old bread) in Business on SEZ-DXB leg. However can not understand the policy of EK to serve breakfast on a night flight at 3am on DXB-SEZ leg in Economy whereas the C-Cl and First Class Pax could sleep. Crew in general were polite but seemed very unorganised with bad service in Business Class on SEZ-DXB leg: they just served coffee and tea after breakfast with no refills and no additional drink rounds or offers. Personally addressed in C only on the DXB-MUC leg but also forgot after dinner to serve coffee or tea and the chocolate to me and my wife. In MUC they had troubles fixing the airbridge at the upper deck which resulted in late disembarking of all C and F-Class pax so at the passport control all Y-Pax (almost 300-400) were in front while the priority baggage was already on the bag carousel. IFE as already mentioned before: wonderful but not working properly on DXB-SEZ leg.,10,3rd May 2014,Germany
2151,Flew LGW to SYD via DXB then Perth to LGW. All four flights were on time and pain free. Able to book seats on all flights well in advance and choose rear doubles on 777-300s which gave additional space albeit with crew reserved seats behind. Caught up on most of the films I had wanted to see for the past 6 months and a few more beside. Very good quality meals with real metal cutlery provided. Rest rooms were kept clean by flight crew who were always available to offer service - although not too difficult when they are only just behind you! Love to get the chance to fly Emirates again. Wish they flew direct to USA from London!,7,1st May 2014,United Kingdom
2152,Dubai - Brisbane. We were incredibly lucky to find our economy cabin only half full so were each able to have a row of seats to ourselves and could stretch out and relax/sleep. Cabin staff were wonderful. We had just come off an Emirates flight from Paris to Dubai where the cabin crew bickered and insulted each other so were pleasantly surprised to have friendly and helpful crew on this leg. Food was good. Drinks were provided regularly throughout the flight. Toilets were kept maintained. Staff were attentive and came promptly if called. I hope our flights in June/July with Emirates are as good as this one.,6,30th April 2014,Australia
2153,First problem on EK018 only 1 USB port worked between 3 seats. When I placed the food tray down there was remnants of the last meal and coffee stains all over it. EK805 delayed approx. 2.5 hours combined with delay in immigration caused me to miss my connecting flight in Jeddah resulting in a 9 hour wait for a place on connecting flight. I arrived at my destination in Medinah 12 hours after I was supposed to. EK802 delayed 1.5 hrs from Jeddah. I ordered Asian veg meal but was served an omelette with sausage. EK017 delayed 15-20 mins causing me to miss my train which I had booked before travelling. The food on the outward journey was very bland but on the flight to Manchester was wonderful. The only consolation is I was travelling alone and not with my family.,8,30th April 2014,United Kingdom
2154,LHR-DXB-LHR in Y on A380 - for leg room and width still the best in economy on this plane - I'm 6'3 no problems on a 7 hrs flight. IFE excellent as always. Food - EK have changed there attractive economy meal tray set ups to all half size trays and very standard shape dishes - food still good but no room to move things round and very charter carrier style - shame! Although £391 return to DXB cant complain at all.,10,30th April 2014,United Kingdom
2155,MAN-DXB-HKT in business. Excellent in every aspect. Picked up at home by driver lounge facility at Manchester were most impressive. Comfort levels on 777 were very high and better than on the A380. EK will be my airline of choice in the future. The whole experience was of the highest standard but spoiled by the lamentable security staff at Manchester. This was beyond the control of Emirates.,1,30th April 2014,United Kingdom
2156,MUC-DXB-JNB - Very good experience. Great A380 and Boeing 777 clean bright and colourful inside good seats. Wonderful entertainment on flights. Great food and drinks. For veggie very good meals (asiatic and lacto-ovo). Nice the idea of the menu printed for each passenger and the stickers to put on seat to remind staff to wake you up if fallen asleep during meals time! A sweet fragrance applied to the cabin before departure pleasant! The service quick and complete. Crew members very helpful smiles in each circumstance and well-instructed. Toilets often cleaned up. We had a great sleep with the little lights on the top of the cabin and awoke with soft orange pink lights in the early morning.,2,28th April 2014,Italy
2157,Fortunate enough to fly EK without going to Dubai flew MEL-AKL-MEL aircraft on both ways were the A380-800 very good experience on both ways both on time. Food was fine FA's are very attentive the ICE entertainment was top class. Would fly them again in the future and would highly recommend them at least on this sector.,1,28th April 2014,Australia
2158,EK503 Bombay to Dubai newest 777ER300. Left around 15 minutes late but arrived on time. The newest 777ER300 had the ultra-modern ICE (Information Communication Entertainment) System with touch-enabled extra-wide screens. Remotes were looking like Ipads. State-of-the art InFlight Entertainment system. The aircraft was new and looked very clean. Everything was in perfect order. There were star like mini-lights on the passenger walkway ceiling which gave a calm effect. Ground crew were very helpful and answered all queries. The Cabin Crew were extremely helpful friendly and responded to all requests very quickly. Unlike other airlines Emirates has very comfortable seats with plenty of leg space in Economy. The Business and First class portrayed infinite luxury never seen before in any other airline. The food was very appetizing. The food is selected according to the flight route which means that the food is selected according to the cuisine of the departure and arrival cities. I had the Chicken Biryani and it was the tastiest Chicken Biryani I have had so far!,9,27th April 2014,India
2159,DXB to JFK On A380 Business Class. Special check in counters for business class and the lounge had nice food choices. Spectacular service inflight with excellent food choice and wines. FA very attentive and very comfortable seat the best airline so far.,9,27th April 2014,United States
2160,EK20 MAN-DXB overnight on 25-26 April (B777-300ER) connecting with EK863 DXB-MCT on 26 April (A330-200). The chauffeur service arrived promptly at my home and as always was immaculately turned out. Our drive to Manchester was made tedious by heavy Friday traffic but the driver handled everything calmly and with good humour. At the terminal I was checked in swiftly and 20 minutes later was in the Emirates lounge (this included time spent picking up some last-minute purchases). Boarding was on time and the flight left slightly early. After watching a film and enjoying supper I got 4 hours solid sleep waking up about 50 minutes out of Dubai. We landed a few minutes early and it took only 20 minutes including the security check to get to the gate for my connecting flight despite this leaving from Concourse C and the arrival having parked right at the end of Concourse B. The flight to Muscat had particularly personable cabin crew; we were on time and for a change I even had a light breakfast on this 40-minute hop rather than falling asleep! In all a perfect trip: no fuss no worries. I make this journey every 5 weeks and this was the kind of faultless seamless performance that sets Emirates apart and makes my regular 'commute' to Muscat much more than merely tolerable.,10,27th April 2014,United Kingdom
2161,I flew KHI-DXB-JNB and return same route. This time I flew London Gatwick-DXB-ISB. The aircraft's were new and tidy. But the toilet had a broken handwash and it was not that clean. I was not provided with headphones and had to ask for them. Staff were not attentive and seemed in a rush. Secondly I asked for water the cabin crew came after such a very long time. The food was good but the service was not enough good.,4,25th April 2014,Pakistan
2162,EK404 Dubai to Singapore 777ER300 14 April 2014. Left around 30 minutes late but arrived on time into Singapore. Cabin crew excellent meal was excellent with the crew constantly wandering around the plane handing out drinks and snacks. In flight entertainment was excellent. The trip was just on 8 hours long during the day but thanks to the service and IFE the time flew by.,9,24th April 2014,Australia
2163,NCL-DXB-DAC-DXB-NCL. Departed from NCL on newest 777-300ER with newest ICE system flight very full but experience was overall pleasant. Catering from NCL is generally always good there was nothing to complain about and staff were efficient and generally good if not over-friendly. Flight from DXB-DAC was on time and again very full on older 777-200 with older ICE system. Cabin Crew on this sector were excellent however and even checked in on my mother who had been upgraded to Business Class for us. Toilets in ridiculous state given 4 hour flight but again due to clientele rather than crews fault. Return was on Christmas Eve and surprisingly busy flight from DAC-DXB. Return flight is always over-timed by an hour - meant we didn't get on to the plane until an hour after arriving at the gate. Flight was on newer 777-200ER with newest ICE system. Cabin service was efficient and brusque if not necessarily very friendly and inflight catering was ok. Arrival into Dubai was early and the airport was very quiet - we had a wait of more than 4 hours for connection to NCL - so collected our complimentary food vouchers from transfer desk. DXB-NCL unusually on 3 class 777-300ER with newest ICE system. Cabin Crew were unusually mostly British due to a lot returning home for Christmas break. Catering was disappointing with choice particularly breakfast offering but otherwise pleasant. Arrival into NCL was late and held on tarmac for rather unusual amount of time before being parked at remote stand and bussed to terminal. Baggage out promptly. Would use again based on this experience - the sector DAC is never an easy one and on the whole Emirates made the experience rather more tolerable than it can be and the price was incredible value for money especially long-haul from a regional UK destination.,10,24th April 2014,United Kingdom
2164,EK355 Singapore to Dubai A380 10 April 2014. We had aisle seats the service was excellent with an excellent meal. Inflight entertainment was extremely good with a vast selection to choose from during the 8 hour flight. Flight left a little late but arrived on time into Dubai at 0.55. Cabin crew very attentive and provided great service to those of us in cattle class throughout the flight.,4,24th April 2014,Australia
2165,BHX-DXB-KUL. Probably the worst long haul flights I have had. Emirates seems to have deteriorated considerably since my last trip in 2010. Outbound flight was spoilt by passengers who wandering about the cabin visiting friends/relatives at all hours of the night and were not controlled by the cabin crew even when seat belt signs were lit. Although things were better on the return legs staff seemed generally disinterested and demoralised. Food service was very slow (over an hour to serve breakfast). Drinks were served after the meal rather than before. Altogether a very disappointing experience.,7,23rd April 2014,United Kingdom
2166,24 Jan 2014 EK412 Dubai - Sydney. I am well travelled and have experienced many airlines but this was the worst in terms of staff inexperience and rudeness. The service was appalling with a young rude and inexperienced cabin crew. I had to ask to have my food tray removed on two occasions. I had to ask for coffee and when it arrived without apology it was cold. There was no help with overhead storage. They need to take notice of customer complaints.,2,23rd April 2014,Australia
2167,"Flew EK 74 EK382 business class April 6. Cabin staff good although noticed difference of service between the 2 flights in term of welcome I am a skywards member and the ""welcome back"" when you board not always there. Toiletries pouch given on one sector not on the other why? Where EK fails miserably is on ground staff sometimes rude and not really concerned with passengers experience and well being Late departure from CDG (accepted) which meant missing connection in DXB although promised that we would make (unacceptable) and late departure from DXB (unexplained) which meant missing connection in HKG and refused access to Lounge for 12 hours wait.",8,22nd April 2014,France
2168,I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 8 years and up to 2 years ago I had no real problems and planes were never delayed more than 5 or 10 mins. However in the last 2 years I have increasingly experienced delays which coupled with the ludicrous different terminal and concourse situation at Dubai has led to problems in transfers at DXB. My last two trips LGW-DXB-Bkk involved 4 sector flights each and in those trips only one flight was on time. Last night I flew DXB to LGW on a A380 (500 passengers) arriving at the boarding gate 45 mins before departure I saw that boarding had started and majority of economy passengers had boarded. I was told there was a delay so better to wait in the business lounge. Only one announcement was made. No further announcements or information given. 70 mins later a large Indian tour party (40 persons) arrived at the gate and immediately a final call for boarding was issued and the flight took off. Clearly the flight of 500 persons was delayed to satisfy the tour party. Talking to fellow passengers at DXB on the plane and at LGW it seems the reliability is slipping. The service on board is hit and miss and in fact last night's service DXB-LGW and the LGW ground support was the worst I have experienced.,2,22nd April 2014,United Kingdom
2169,I'm a regular traveller albeit mainly short haul. When visiting friends I wanted to experience a flight on an Airbus 380 in Business. Big disappointment but waited to form an opinion until after the return flight. In my view there are just too many business class passengers to cabin crew and it is just not possible to get the level of service you expect from a business class flight. Significantly inferior to other aircraft configurations. Food quality was poor and you are left without being asked if you would like a glass of wine to go with your meal. By the time they arrive the meal is finished. I would recommend you avoid this if you want a high level experience. I usually try to fly via Doha with Qatar when going in this direction and will return to that route of travel in future.,4,21st April 2014,United Kingdom
2170,SYD-DXB-CDG and CMN-DXB. Seating is tight particularly on the 777 compared to the A380 (don't like the 10 abreast idea). Cabin staff look good and do everything expected of them but do seem a little cold and lack warmth. Was disappointed that both DXB arrivals were at remote gates which makes the arrival experience tedious. Used the Dubai Connect hotel/transfer service from Casablanca (connecting onto Qantas at DXB) which is a godsend. Was impressed how efficiently it all worked. DXB airport is huge but works reasonably well. Enjoyed using the Business Lounge possible because of my Qantas Club membership. IFE is excellent.,6,21st April 2014,Australia
2171,I flew from Copenhagen to Dubai in January 2014 on the brand new 777-ER. The seats were comfortable and the service was excellent. For the entertainment you didn't need to use the corded control they supplied you with a tablet to control your entertainment. If you didn't like the screen or you wanted to play games the tablet was a great option. I had some problems with the people in front of me. It was a family of 3 the child tossed crisps onto me and the parents couldn't care less. Staff said nothing to the parents.,8,21st April 2014,South Korea
2172,HKG-DXB-MXP (Malpensa Milan) in Business Class - my first experience with Emirates and an excellent experience overall. Superb service food and wine. As a Qantas Platinum I was able to use the Emirates First Class Lounge while in transit through Dubai and was served a delicious lunch and fine wine with impeccable service. In regards to the flights themselves I cannot think of a single negative comment to make.,6,21st April 2014,Australia
2173,Flew from LAX to Dubai on 3/25/14 and back on 4/15/14. The service level was poor! The food was lousy and the bathrooms were dirty and out of stock! There were trash on the cabin floor and none of the attendants bothered to pick it up! The food trays stayed in front of passengers for at least 40 minutes before they were picked up. The internet connection was very poor and I kept being disconnected every few seconds! When passengers myself included used the button to call an attendant no one paid any attention! Mine was on for 30 minutes before an attendant turned it off while he was passing by and didn't even bother to ask me why I turned it on!,9,19th April 2014,United States
2174,I've flown Emirates on a regular basis for 6 or 7 years and it seems the reliability is slipping. LGW-BKK-LGW - all flights were late (up to 1.5 hours) except the DXB-LGW leg. 2.5 hour connections in DXB are now becoming very tight and stressful due to lateness of flights and the inordinate amount of bussing in DXB. Check-In (online) on all flights excellent. As for the flights themselves all very full so Emirates must be doing something right. Cabin Service in Business is OK but nothing special and in Economy is very much dependent on the crew - can be highly variable. On the plus side the in flight entertainment is good the prices are competitive and frequent fliers are frequently upgraded. The bad news is that Emirates seem to be expanding faster than DXB is so I don't see the transit experience getting any better any time soon.,10,16th April 2014,United Kingdom
2175,EK231 April 14 2014. Overall experience: unsatisfactory rude flight attendants. My first time flying economy class with Emirates and I will never use them again. Flight attendants were rude when serving meals. My wife was asked what kind of food she would like and she said chicken. In a rude tone the flight attendant said they were out of chicken and only had vegetarian while throwing the meal to my wife. When serving the second meals (breakfast) the same thing happened. Finally she came back with the food of our choice.,3,16th April 2014,United States
2176,EK242 Toronto to Dubai 4/9/2014. EK524 Dubai to Hyderabad India 4/10/2014. It was a great experience this was my first time with this airline. Excellent customer service crew members were very helpful. The complimentary food was excellent.,8,14th April 2014,Canada
2177,April 6 to April 11. Flight 206 from New York and 205 from Milan Italy. I was very surprised to learn upon check in that the carry on requirements for economy consists of one bag that has to weigh no more than 7 kilos. In my entire life I have never had my carry on bag weighed so this was surprising. Many carry on bags can weigh up to 8 lbs for just the bag depending on the construction so 7 kilos is unreasonable to an extreme. Otherwise the flight was more enjoyable than most but given this unreasonable weight requirement I cannot fly Emirates again unfortunately. My carryon was weighed which put me into a position to have to decide if I should check an expensive camera and laptop and how to do that for which there really was no solution. A supervisor eventually came over took one fast look at the contents of my carry on without me saying anything and said it's fine but there was a good 10 minutes of discussing what to do before that.,10,14th April 2014,United States
2178,Flew on 31/10/2013 from Dubai to New Delhi. It was a pleasant flight and luckily got upgraded to Business class at the boarding counter. Nice and pleasant cabin crew and a nice spacious seat. The food was good but the service during the meals was satisfactory. We were introduced to a variety of snacks throughout the flight. The In-Flight system was excellent and it was easy to pass the 3 hours.,9,13th April 2014,United Arab Emirates
2179,April 9 2014. This is my second trip from Dubai to Toronto both trips had the same problems: Delay at Dubai airport. Rude staff. Food was bad. It was not worth the money. It's a direct flight but too many headaches involved. Unfortunately unpleasant experience.,8,10th April 2014,Canada
2180,My second time with Emirates I flew from GVA-DXB-CGK vv. All the flights were better than I expected/experienced. I have flown with Emirates in 2011 and these flight were much better. Flight attendants were attentive (especially my flight from CGK to DXB) food was nice as expected nothing to complain about with the seat and best entertainment system ICE. All flights were on time. Cabin onboard clean and nice mood lighting system with star lights.,10,10th April 2014,Switzerland
2181,Flew 27/01/14 from Glasgow to Dubai for the first time in business class and couldn't fault it! I was mesmerised with the room for a start and the service couldn't have been better. Although a bit slow on boarding the plane but didn't realise that all passengers enter via business class? Doesn't make sense to me!,10,10th April 2014,United Kingdom
2182,Overall service: unsatisfactory. Flight 232 on 3/1/14 from Washington DC to Dubai. Plane was dirty and flight attendants were rude. These people needs to be retrain as far as providing good customer service to their passengers. Example: It took almost 2 hours to clear the trays after we ate. Upon arriving in Dubai we had to walk from one end of the concourse to the other end to catch our connecting flight from Dubai to the Philippines. Upon reaching the gate we were told we had to go back to where we came from to catch the same flight. After another hour or so of waiting we were told to go to another place to catch the plane this was when we were put in a shuttle and driven to where the plane was. Upon boarding I asked one of the flight attendants of what was going on and instead of listening she started arguing with me. This was my first time flying with this airlines and will be my last.,10,6th April 2014,United States
2183,EK5102 1/4/14 seat 34b return 5/4/14 on 43a. I have had the pleasure of flying LHR-DXB-LHR on their A380 airbus which is truly king of the skies! Their economy seat 42A is superb. The seat and their ICE entertainment is first class! The level of service is second to none. I have flown Virgin many times Emirates is in a league of their own! I would thoroughly recommend them as they were fantastic!,5,6th April 2014,United Kingdom
2184,We travelled from Perth to Manchester via Dubai. Perth to Dubai was ok. Dubai to Manchester was a disgrace. There were 3 choices of food on the menu beef chicken curry or a seafood dish. Our choice was beef we were told there was none left. I don't eat curry and seafood is a definitely no no on a flight. I was offered a vegetarian option which was inedible. 2 hours into the flight which was 5pm all the lights went out and the blinds came down.,10,6th April 2014,United Kingdom
2185,We flew from Dubai (DXB) to Moscow (DME) on April 6th economy class while our flight had been scheduled on April 5th. airline changed aircraft Airbus-380 to Boing-777 3 hours before departure without any notification. Airport check-in machine was returning error during our attempts no information at check-in desks. Not all passengers could get their seats because of B777 smaller capacity. However airline provided hotel meal and extra round-trip ticket. Flight was on-time. Flight was not very good they ran out of food choices and food quality was awful. Overall service become worse.,9,6th April 2014,Russian Federation
2186,The measure of an airline is how they behave when things are not going right. My experience of this airline is that they tell lies and are a disorganized rabble. They were 2 hours late out of Sydney which they blamed on the late arrival of the plane however as the flight was leaving at 6.00 am and there is a curfew in Sydney this was not true. We were told on check in that they would make up time in the air which they did not. We were told they would make the connecting flights wait in Dubai which they did not. The ground staff at Dubai were unprepared and uninformed as to what was planned for us. I will not use this airline again.,10,6th April 2014,Australia
2187,Flew from JFK to Dubai in March 2014 with final destination Lahore Pakistan. Liked the new A380 but economy seats are not comfortable as compared to 777. The worst part is window seats are useless because A380 double window distance is too wide to enjoy looking outside. The meal service was terrible both ways. Only 3 distinct ethnic foods in menu and usually then ran out off some of them (usually what I liked). I complained and was told that its very difficult to serve 400+ economy passengers and take care all of their food types. I was dismayed by the answer. Their 777 from Dubai to Lahore was old. I usually fly using PIA which is a direct flight from JFK to Lahore. Unless I want to see Dubai or this route is short I will never use Emirates to go to Pakistan. Don't see any major difference. PIA is not bad at all when you actually compare with Emirates.,1,6th April 2014,United States
2188,Manchester to Perth business class. Experience from Manchester to Dubai was very disappointing. Boarding was chaotic and very disorganised the service from the young male attendants very poor. They had run out of my food choice and the business section was almost empty. The food I was given the seafood stew was inedible. The TV did not work a lady did move me but that was just an hour before we landed. All in all a bad experience. Considering the cost of the flight I have travelled with Emirates in economy and the service was better. Flight from Dubai to Perth was better the attendants were excellent - what a difference that made.,1,3rd April 2014,United Kingdom
2189,Washington Dulles (IAD) direct to Dubai. I have no complaints at all for this flight. My complaint comes from my return. Was at the airport (Dubai) 3 hours early. No problem going through security. I will just skip to the problem. Poor communication. We were delayed 7 hours yes 7 hours and no one to tell us anything. We sat on the plane for 3 hours before we were told the plane was being taken out of service. Sat at the gate for another 3 hours and still no word. We finally heard from passengers that had been inquiring that we needed to be at gate B32 from B18 and the plane will depart in an hour. Really. No one from the airlines said a word. Once we got on board there weren't any problems. Communication is key.,2,2nd April 2014,United States
2190,Flew BNE-DXR-LHR and return on A380 all legs. I had great crew on every single leg who were friendly and attended to our wants at all times. In between meal services we were constantly supplied with water/juice. All legs bar one departed on or close to time (dep LHR one hour late but arrived pretty much on time to DXB). My only complaint would be the lack of leg room in economy class and the bottom part of the seat was a bit too soft. Seat width was fine and meals were just above the average for economy class Would recommend Emirates economy for a competitive price and decent service as long as you remember if you want top shelf seats and service to fly business or first! Wifi service is non existent/very hard to connect to in DXB which isn't an emirates thing but does reflect on them as it's their home airport.,1,1st April 2014,Australia
2191,We flew from Heathrow to Dubai on an Airbus 380 early in December 2013 on this trip they ran out of food choices and I was told that I could not get the chicken that I had asked for. The flight crew were harassed and totally disorganized. When we few back in March 2014 exactly the same thing happened - sorry we have run out of the choice you asked for on the menu. Also my headphones were not working after having had the light on for about two hours I eventually got up and went to the crew to ask for another one. Emirates prides itself on good service and this was not the case on the Airbus. We flew from Dubai to Johannesburg and back on a 777 and I cannot fault the service on these planes.,3,1st April 2014,United Kingdom
2192,"Good flights WAW-DXB-NRT. WAW-NRT not so full with amazing staff DXB-BRT full but ok (good ICE great food). Inflight Entertainment on WAW-DXB is not so good as this is old A330 plane. But this sector is not so long. FAs were attentive to ""call"" button and soft drinks were served repetitively between main meals (and it was not problem to get a beer if you ask and wait a minute).",8,31st March 2014,Poland
2193,Travelled business class from Sydney to Lyon - a long flight. All was very good A380 very comfortable seats and plenty of room. No delays. Food was OK have had better on another airline. Main issue is that I had to wait about 20 minutes for a toilet as the staff were changing in there!! Not good enough when you are paying extra for business class! Otherwise the flight was excellent.,10,31st March 2014,France
2194,MAN-AKL (via DXB and SYD) and return. A388 used on all sectors. Fantastic planes - very quiet in comparison to 747s and 777s. The ICE in-flight entertainment system was second to none so much choice and easy to use. The staff were uniformly friendly and would go out of their way to help. For some reason our pre-booked seats were changed at the gate. When we boarded we complained to a member of cabin staff and they made sure we were seated in the seats we had booked on-line. I slept really well on my flights and the seat pitch was good (I am 6 ft). Will definitely fly long haul with them again.,10,31st March 2014,United Kingdom
2195,Flew on EK 108 from Larnaca to Dubai on their brand new 777-300er. Overall clean plane crew very attentive and appeared as soon as call buttons were pressed. Inflight entertainment worked without a glitch and the food was delicious. Keep it up Emirates!,3,30th March 2014,Cyprus
2196,TPE-DBX-NCL Business Class. Second time to fly business class on Emirates after many years flying mostly economy. Service was outstanding from chauffeur pick-up through check-in and most importantly onboard everything went smoothly and everyone was extremely professional and helpful. Drinks and food were plentiful and well presented and when I was unable to get one preferred meal option the cabin crew were very apologetic even expressing their apologies again as I disembarked. It was hardly their fault but I appreciated that they felt it could be important to a passenger. Seats were amazing and i recommend the mattress to add that little extra comfort throughout the flight. ICE was great but on first leg the B777 felt slightly older and the control panel less responsive than on the DBX-NCL leg. Cabin crew couldn't have been more helpful and polite. I've flown economy 15+ times with Emirates and have never had any complaints about their quality or service but it was worth paying the extra to be in business class for two long flights and be pampered. DBX business lounge in Terminal 3 is a little too basic but I won't complain about the snacks or drinks available. Logged on to complimentary wifi easily. I'm looking forward to my return trip.,7,28th March 2014,Taiwan
2197,SYD-DXB on A380. More room than on the 777 but very disappointed with this leg. Cabin was freezing even with two blankets. Sat in seat 51D which was last row in front of galley. VERY noisy and every 20 seconds or so there was a loud gushing noise like an Arctic wind which sent the temperature even lower. Sound on my IFE was very unreliable and despite a promise to reboot it it never happened. Food was tepid and bland. Overall not very good.,2,28th March 2014,United Kingdom
2198,BKK - Hong Kong on A380 in business class. The BKK EK lounge is being refurbished and I was asked to use Qantas lounge. The Emirates rep in that lounge was superbly helpful and pleasant. Onboard my seat area was clean and everything worked. I did not find the seat too comfortable and used the mattress. After take off the on-board bar opened. The bar person could not speak English well was disorganized and had no idea how to mix drinks. There was a nice selection of tasty sandwiches wraps etc. I asked for the warm food printed on the bar menu and was told 'we will put it out if we have time'. After challenging this they reluctantly heated some for me. I was then told to go back to my seat as lunch will be served. I sat with a table cloth in front of me for a further 20 mins and then a tray of food arrived. The steak in balsamic vinegar and creamy potato was good and tasty. There was a crew member walking up and down serving wines which was positive too. The toilets were not well stocked with tooth brushes etc but were clean. I found the crew awful - with fake smiles patronizing and they ran around like disorganized headless chickens tripping over each other and created a very anxious atmosphere in the cabin. They treated the passengers with contempt and I felt that I was an inconvenience to them.,8,28th March 2014,Thailand
2199,We travelled on the A380 from LHR to Dubai. Upon entering the plane first impressions was wonderful the inflight entertainment was great. Though that is the only good thing about this airline the cabin crew is the worst. The crew are awful they don't care about service at all we waited over 3 hours after we pressed the call button for a stewardess to come. The food is awful nothing but a horrible chicken curry on the menu on both legs of the journey. The final meal served will probably be a biscuit and a cup of tea. I had high hopes for this airline but they are really awful Dubai is a wonderful place to visit but don't fly with this airline.,7,28th March 2014,United Kingdom
2200,BKK - Hong Kong on A380 in business class. The BKK EK lounge is being refurbished and I was asked to use Qantas lounge. The Emirates rep in that lounge was superbly helpful and pleasant. Onboard my seat area was clean and everything worked. I did not find the seat too comfortable and used the mattress. After take off the on-board bar opened.

2202,DXB-CMBEK 650 First Class Suites B777-300ER. The First Class Lounge in Terminal 3 (B Gates) was good and the menu service meals were excellent. Boarding was not well organized. Inflight service was excellent but not outstanding given that First Class was not full. Each suite is very comfortable and well laid-out though the decor is amazingly garish. No privacy when the sliding doors are open unlike some First Class suite designs of their competitors. No amenity kit as it was a four-hour night flight. Was promised socks toothpaste/brush and eye shades but never received any. Toothpaste/brush shaving cream/razor and combs were available in the well- maintained toilets for self service. Meals were very poor for First Class though well presented. I ordered the Sri Lankan meal (Chicken Koththu Roti) but it was hotter than anything I've been served in Colombo and was truly tasteless. I sent it back and ordered an omelette that was the exact opposite (too bland) and had a machine made look about it. One expects much better in First Class especially as I recall the amazingly delicious food Emirates served in First Class ten years ago on a LHR-DXB flight served from a trolley rather than on trays like now and a more recent meal in First Class served by EK last year on a CMB-DXB flight. I know everyone is looking at cost-cutting measures but this is supposedly First Class. The flight departed DXB and arrived in CMB on time. Baggage delivery in CMB was prompt and baggage transfer from BA at DXB was very well handled by EK. For a four hour flight EK Business Class which I typically use on this route seems a better value.,9,27th March 2014,United States
2203,EK371 Bangkok to Dubai on 23rd Mar. Flew Emirates on the late night flight at 1.55am. Crew were fantastic and meals and drinks were plentiful and served with a smile. Aircraft not too new but clean and ICE was very enjoyable.,10,24th March 2014,United Kingdom
2204,EK 027 DXB to GLA on 23rd Mar. Aircrew were outstanding and very professional. Meals were tasty and enjoyable. Aircraft was new with excellent ICE range of all the latest movies. Aircrew were very friendly and worked well serving refreshments during the whole flight with a good caring smiling attitude and did a fantastic job.,1,24th March 2014,United Kingdom
2205,Manchester - Dubai -–Phuket -–Dubai - Manchester. Flew on the A380 on the Manchester legs and the 777 on the Phuket leg. Both experiences top class crews on all sectors excellent. Food and beverages first class. A fantastic experience that I hope to do again.,10,24th March 2014,United Kingdom
2206,Caught EK408 from KL back to Melbourne on 21 March. From the lounge to the arrival the staff were fantastic. The inflight entertainment along with the meal starved should make Qantas wake up. Both beat Qantas and was served with staff who smiled and were a pleasure. Looking forward to my next flight in a week or so!,2,24th March 2014,Australia
2207,DUS-DXB-CGK (Dusseldorf - Jakarta) on 08/09 March and return 21 March. All flights 777 300ER. Air fares a fraction of what Lufthansa offered. Very satisfied with flights on time and service prior to take off and at the airports. Service during flight overall OK but staff could be more attentive. Seats a bit old partly broken. Met a friend in Economy and found out the main dish was exactly the same food I ordered in Business! Was not hungry when lunch was served and 2 hours later there was nothing left over except for desserts was disappointed.,2,24th March 2014,Germany
2208,EK 409 on 16 March. Left on a 3.20am flight that I would not really recommend given the time. Travelling business I at least thought the staff would promptly go around the cabin and get any services out the way ASAP. I wanted a nightcap to help me sleep and it took an amazing 1.5 hours before I got it. I have travelled Emirates before and they have been good but a little more attention to customers paying for service regardless of time would not go astray. The one saving grace was inflight entertainment.,2,24th March 2014,Australia
2209,SYD-BKK-DXB then to LHR. SYD-BKK leg was late by about an hour. This was EK 419 on 7/3/2014. Lay flat bed was hard and not actually lie flat. Food was less than average and certainly of a lesser quality than economy flight outbound. Wine served warm no offer of pudding or cheese after main course. Very little soft drinks offered and the cabin crew were less than helpful. BKK-DXB: Breakfast served cold asked for the Deli platter but told it was not available. Flight service mediocre - no soft drinks offered. Seat uncomfortable and not lie flat. New cabin crew no better than on SYD-BKK leg. DXB-LHR. As flight was late into DXB was held at arrival gate and then asked to run to next gate - no chance! New A380 to LHR and such a difference to the 777 on the other legs. Great service good food far better seat good food and great cabin crew. Next trip I will go back to Cathay business class which is far better even on a 777.,5,22nd March 2014,United Kingdom
2210,Heathrow to Christchurch on a 777 but was disappointed that the seats which were classed as going flat in fact went to only approx a 30 degree angle with the feet slopping down. I didn't find out until the end of the journey that I could have asked for a mattress. This was disappointing as I have been on a 777 with another company to NZ where the seats went completely flat with feet resting on the day time footrest so there was no problem with sliding down. The configuration of seats with them was also better with individual seats so no stepping over other passengers legs. Apart from that the service was very good and as someone who needs wheelchair assistance I was treated with consideration. I also needed dietary requirements and the food was very good and well presented.,2,22nd March 2014,United Kingdom
2211,EK002 March 16th LHR-DXB. The staff are extremely casual and non-professional. They lack the basic courtesy on how to serve premium passengers. As we entered the business class cabin en-route from London-Dubai two of the flight attendants were chatting away near our seat about social media and twitter etc! They didn't seem to notice at all that passengers had already boarded. Though the staff were not rude they were extremely casual in service.,9,22nd March 2014,India
2212,Flew GVA-DXB on 17/3 DXB-DOH-DXB on 18/3 DXB-GVA on 20/3. Excellent trip with perfect service and excellent value for money Staff as usual very professional and the IFE definitely on top of what I've experienced so far. Catering was also excellent and I was served a complete meal even on a 45 min flight between DXB and DOH.,8,21st March 2014,Switzerland
2213,MAN-DXB-SGN - left MAN 1 hour late. The Etihad flight was due to depart at the same time started boarding much earlier and left early Emirates always start boarding too late. Poor service onboard with very limited drinks offered fortunately I had bottled water with me. Boarded plane at DXB in plenty of time but departed 1 hour late informed by pilot this was because of the delay in getting peoples baggage through the airport and onto the plane as basically the airport could not cope with the amount of passengers/flights. Arrived in SGN but only one bag did the other never made the flight along with 20 other passengers bags took 2 days to get the other bag.,6,21st March 2014,United Kingdom
2214,EK230 2/26 SEA-DXB. EK775 3/3 DXB-DUR. EK776 3/14 DUR-DXB. EK229 3/16 DXB-SEA. First time flying Emirates. Found staff to be very attentive to our every need. On the first meal service our first choice of meal was not available they made a note and when they came back through with the second meal service they ensured that we got to tell them our choice before they went through the rest of the cabin. The seat is very comfortable considering the configuration. I would deduct a star as they really do cram the seats in by adding 2 additional seats in every town when most airlines add an inch to the seat width and have a 2x4x2 configuration Emirates elects to do 3x4x3 which feels a lot more cramped than other 777 aircraft I have been on. Food was excellent with great choices. Inflight entertainment is really the best I have experienced especially the aircraft that had the latest version of the ICE system loaded. There was no shortage of excellent entertainment to help pass the long hours on the flight.,9,19th March 2014,United States
2215,KIX-LIS via Dubai. Both B777-300ER. First plane was rather old and choice of movies surprisingly limited. Seat did not go to 180º flat. Food and Japanese CA very nice. Drinks not very high standard. On time. Wi-Fi at Dubai lounge not good. Second flight a very new aircraft. Fabulous ICE. Fantastic staff. Food was just average and drinks much better. Why is EK not succeeding in having a standard of service? Arrived earlier.,8,19th March 2014,Brazil
2216,CPH-DXB-BKK early February. Flight out of Copenhagen delayed 3 hours passengers got food coupons flight one hour quicker than scheduled - no problems in reaching connection flight. On board 777-300ER service very good food better than on most other airlines pre-dinner drinks wine and cognac served during meal. Seat comfort however average with rather hard seats and 3x4x3 arrangement making you feel crammed on a sold-out flight as this. I recently flew Turkish Airlines where 3x3x3 arrangements in more comfortable seats made journey more comfortable. However IFE excellent especially music selection. Flight attendant forgot to serve coffee but - as a compensation - offered mini-bottle of cognac at end of flight. All in all a very good experience. While in Dubai staff quick to inform us about BKK flight a marvellous 380. Again seats average but otherwise a great experience on this new silent giant.,9,17th March 2014,Denmark
2217,9th March from Dubai to London at 16.30. Flight EK 005/QF 8005. Cabin crew were brilliant all done with a smile and they were very busy. Would definitely travel with Emirates again.,10,17th March 2014,United Kingdom
2218,My wife and I recently flew JFK-DXB-BKK and I returned BKK-DXB-JFK. My wife will return next week. Going out we had a pretty good trip to Dubai although the plane left late. Waited in transit in Dubai but were delayed again. Onboard told the problem had been fixed and we would depart shortly. When we got to BKK we waited for our luggage (3 pieces) only to be told it was still in Dubai. We found out 300 passengers from JFK had the same problem. On my way back check-in at BKK was a nightmare due to the fact that over 500 people were checking in. The Airbus A380-800s are just too big to handle the necessary ground operations to support them. Flight was OK to DXB nothing special. In transit at DXB I checked on which gate I was to board at and went to wait. After an interminable wait and seeing nothing I checked the board only to find out that they had changed departure gates but posted no signs or made no announcements about this. I made a mad dash to the new gate and just made it before they closed it. I was in a three-seat row with a window seat and one other passenger in the aisle seat. Behind me was a family with 2 little kids. From the minute I sat down until the time I got off the plane the kids yelled and cried. There was no problem resolution from the stewardess although there were a number of options that she could have implemented. Ground operations are terrible and their flight crew appear to know nothing about problem resolution.,10,17th March 2014,United States
2219,From DXB to MLE on a Boeing 777 was even better than the A380 business class. Seats comfort and luxury was all on that Boeing 777 and none of that was on an A380 seat. I'm going back to Male on the 12th March 2014 and I'm going on the Boeing 777.,4,17th March 2014,United Arab Emirates
2220,In February and March 2014 we travelled from Dulles Washington DC to Dubai to New Delhi and then back. Most of the journey was on 777-ER all the departures and arrivals were on time food and drinks were tasty and entertainment was awesome. Coming from Dubai to Washington DC it was night time flight there were not enough water or drink rounds. Every year we have travelled Emirates to visit India since 2005 and will try to do it again next year.,7,14th March 2014,United States
2221,Last October my wife and I flew from London to Hong Kong return with stop-overs in Dubai. We were in economy class on their Airbus 380 and Boeing 777s. This was a great experience in every respect. The aircraft cabins were in excellent shape comfortable seats with good leg space and the entertainment system worked flawlessly with a grand selection of films and music. Meal service was exceptionally fine. Receiving hot meals included in the air fare on economy class is a scarce treat nowadays. Moreover we were offered free drinks and extra snacks on our 7 hrs. flights on each leg. The cabin crew was highly competent and friendly. We are looking forward to finding an opportunity to fly Emirates again.,1,13th March 2014,Iceland
2222,19 Feb 2014 EK405 MEL-SIN. 23 Feb 2014 EK404 SIN-MEL. Fly frequently but this was the first experience with Emirates. The plane itself was great with good food and entertainment especially with the big screen. Ground crew service at Singapore Airport was a nightmare. System problem with seat allocation which our pre-booked seats were being occupied. Staff were being rude to customers at check in counters. Customers do not come back with this kind of service level.,5,12th March 2014,Australia
2223,Manchester to Clark (Manila North) via Dubai in Economy. Chose this route as my wife's family live very close to Clark airport and it's much easier than grappling with travel from Manila. Outbound to DXB on A380 very comfortable quiet and smooth with attentive service good food and plenty of new films to watch. Similarly DXB to CRK on B777 not as quiet but still reasonably comfortable. On return we were upgraded to Business on CRK/DXB leg (B777) excellent lie-flat seats with massage function brilliant service and food. DXB/MAN same A380 service as outbound. Everything ran either to time or early paid £550 each for the whole trip. Excellent.,7,12th March 2014,United Kingdom
2224,Flew FRA-DXB and DXB-MAD back in February. Generally speaking all aspects of the service were more than satisfactory. From my experience at the ticket counter in FRA where the gentleman was very courteous to checking in online the DXB bag drop with no line and the generally polite service onboard I thought the staff did a very good job of creating an atmosphere of consideration for the passengers. The only thing I missed was that on the flight from FRA to DXB there simply were not enough water runs (although from DXB to MAD there were plenty). I had to ask for water and even then the cup size given to me was more appropriate for a shot of whisky than the generous glass of water I needed. Of course the ICE entertainment system was excellent as was the food service. Overall I would recommend Emirates but I would advise bringing a couple of bottles of water with you to prevent dehydration.,1,11th March 2014,United States
2225,EK0349 8/03/2014. Colombo to Dubai. I found the service terrible. It was 2 hours into the flight before we were served anything not even a drink of water was brought. I even rang for someone to come and it was ignored. Would not use Emirates on this sector again.,7,11th March 2014,Cyprus
2226,Flew London Heathrow to Dubai on A380. We chose seats in row 45. Very efficient check-in and boarding. Aircraft very clean no crumbs down sides of seats or stains on tray. Informative updates from the pilot. Toilets were the best I have used on any aircraft and kept very clean throughout the whole flight. Seats actually very comfortable and space and recline very acceptable for Economy. Food excellent as was the service. All in all very impressed and will endeavour to fly with Emirates again.,9,10th March 2014,United Kingdom
2227,BKK-DXB-DME Business class return. Excellent flight super service as usual too bad the flight between Bangkok and Dubai only last 5 hours. As a gold member the chief cabin comes and welcome you personally on board. Food is very good with great choices.,10,10th March 2014,Thailand
2228,Kolkata to Dubai before connecting to a British Airways flight to Heathrow and an onward connection to Austin Texas. Emirates staff at Kolkata airport upgraded me to business class. The food service and entertainment system was superb and I got a good nights sleep before my onward journey to the United States. The A330 was immaculate cabin crew friendly and well groomed and the airline was punctual and efficient.,10,10th March 2014,United States
2229,A380 from LAX-DXB-MAA. LAX to DXB was the worst. I had an infant child of 9 months old and didn't get a bassinet. Flight attendants said the baby looked too big and the bassinet wouldn't hold him. Had to hold my baby for 15+ hrs. No water was given either when I had to give baby formula. DXB-MAA was much better as they were able to provide a bassinet which unsurprisingly handled the baby just fine.,9,6th March 2014,United States
2230,MAD-DXB-BKK and back. Good service at airports nice and new airplanes comfortable seats (although on 777s the distance between seats is tight so you are touching your neighbor continuously no problem in my case as I was traveling with a friend). IFE was excellent I got the new huge screens on 3 of 4 flights. Food was generally good and crew provided good service. Transit through Dubai Airport was fine. The ticket price was a bargain so I am even more satisfied with Emirates.,7,5th March 2014,Spain
2231,EK 372 on 27th Feb 2014. We have flown regularly with Emirates for many years and have been very happy. The way the airline dealt with us following the alleged baggage system crash on 27th Feb was appalling. Despite the fact that aircrew know that most passengers baggage had not been loaded no information was provided during the flight or at the airport. Instead we were left forlornly waiting at the carousel. By the time people twigged what was happening the two ground staff at the information desk were besieged. They were totally unprepared and chaos ensued. Essentially people were abandoned to their own devices with no attempt to communicate or put contingency arrangements in place. This was a repeat of our experience last year which we attributed to a one off aberration. Frankly you can have all the comfort and good food you like but if your customers walk away feeling angry and frustrated you will not get repeat business. Things do go wrong occasionally and most people are pretty reasonable if they know what is happening.,6,5th March 2014,United Kingdom
2232,22nd Feb 2014 arrived in London Gatwick at 11am for our 1.30pm flight to Dubai to be told that the flight was delayed by 6 hours and would not take off until 7pm. Staff at Gatwick and on the flight were unable to give us any information about our connecting flights to India. Landed in Dubai at 6am on 23rd Feb and although all passengers on the flight had missed their connections there were no ground staff waiting to direct us. Asked to go to the transit desk found more than 500 people crowded into a small space with no proper queue. Only 2 Emirates staff were available. We stood for 4.5 hours with no refreshments. Communication was very poor and we had no idea how long the wait would be. At 10.30 am staff started directing passengers to different gates depending on their destination. We sat until 5.30 pm with no information as to which flight we were likely to catch. Although they handed out food vouchers at 2.30pm they ran out so not everyone got vouchers. At 5.30pm we were finally given boarding cards for the 9.45 pm connecting flight to Trivandrum. Although we waited 16 hours in the airport Emirates were unable to offer us a hotel room or even a lounge. Finally arrived at our destination at 3.45 am on 24th Feb. We appreciate that delays due to bad weather are unavoidable. However Emirates had 24 hours notice after the fog on Saturday morning and did nothing to prepare for the chaos on Sunday. Communication was extremely poor.,2,4th March 2014,United Kingdom
2233,I have flown a few times with Emirates and I can never complain! Had a flight 2 days ago from Sydney to Dubai (14 hours) but it didn't feel that long because the staff were so good.,9,4th March 2014,France
2234,"We were stranded in Dubai for over 24 hours. I mean myself and about 60 other passengers because our connecting flight (also an Emirates flight) left without us. None of us received accommodation no lounge not even a place to take a proper shower or refresh. We didn't receive boarding passes for the next flight for 17 hours or so they kept telling us to ""come back in 2 hours"". This went on all day I couldn't even leave the airport if I wanted to! Emirates had no sense of organization and zero sympathy for passengers.",5,4th March 2014,United States
2235,First time to be disappointed by EK service. Arrived at the airport on time to find out that my flight to JED was delayed 7 hours not to mention check in staff didn't know why and why we had not been informed. Asked if I could leave DXB intl to go home and come back they said no since it was an estimated time and the plane might take off at any time. Stranded at DXB intl for 8 hours. Later on asked another member of ground crew about the update on my flight he was careless to even answer me properly. Onboard 2 female crew were shouting at passengers. Lack of communication from management to staff dealing with passengers is a major problem. On the return RUH-DXB flight on time A330-200 the oldest in EK fleet no entertainment only one meal option I was surprised that they are serving a full meal on this short 90 minutes flight. The most uncomfortable seat on a plane. Those aircraft's should be phased out immediately.,10,3rd March 2014,United Arab Emirates
2236,Manchester to Christchurch via Dubai - 773ER out in Economy and had the best Economy food we have had on a plane. We are frequent flyers and this was excellent coupled with great crews and their entertainment system made a great flight. Trip back from Auckland was two A380's in Business and again we had good attentive crews and the usual level of service befitting their excellent product. Please keep up the good work re the food.,1,3rd March 2014,United Kingdom
2237,We flew from Birmingham to Cape Town business class which involved a change in Dubai. These flights were on Boeing 777ER planes. Every aspect of the flights was of the highest standards such that for the first time in years we actually looked forward to our return flights! The service was excellent with courteous friendly staff and fabulous food and wine. The seats are roomy and comfortable and we slept for 6+ hours on the Dubai-Cape Town sector - well beyond what we have done on BA and other flights. The provision of mattresses for the seats is a wonderful idea. The entertainment system is superb. In addition the chauffeur cars are a great way to being and s=end a trip. Emirates is a great airline and I will definitely now switch to using them for future flights.,9,3rd March 2014,United Kingdom
2238,Singapore - Nice return on a business trip with a transit in Dubai both ways. Overall the quality of the trip was good. Seats comfortable slide suite doors a bit gimmicky but definitely help with privacy / quietness for sleeping. Didn't eat on all legs but when I did the quality of the a la carte food was excellent. Drinks list wide. ICE system has great content but the tablet style controller is sometimes unresponsive. In flight wifi / mobile connectivity only available on one leg out of four which was disappointing as the one leg that had it was a night leg when I wanted to sleep! Emirates First lounge in DXB very comfortable. All flights on time. Only complaints are that the cabins seemed too warm and that Dubai airport remains a bit of a mess for transit. Might be better when all construction works complete. Price for this First trip was barely any higher than Singapore Airlines Business class to Europe so on that basis the value for money is good. This is a regular trip for me and I'd consider EK next time.,8,3rd March 2014,Singapore
2239,Travelling back from Bangkok on 23rd Feb our flight was scheduled to land in Dubai Airport at 00.30 local time. Due to the fog from the previous day in Dubai we were told when checking in that our flight from Bangkok would be delayed 2 hours making our departure time 22.40 instead of 20.40. When we received our boarding passes they were printed with a departure time of 00.10 meaning a delay of 3.5 hours. After 4 + hours of no updated information they called us to the gates. Eventually arrive in Dubai at around 5.30 am local time 5 hours after our scheduled arrival time. After an hour or so with very little movement in queues peoples patience began to wear thin. After 3+ hours we decided to try somewhere else in the airport for answers I eventually got on a flight at 5pm that day and arrived home around 40 hours after leaving my hotel in Bangkok. I am fast approaching 60 years have travelled all over the world using many airlines have experienced delays before but never have I encountered such lack of care.,8,28th February 2014,United Kingdom
2240,LIS-DXB-KIX. Business Class. Two different experiences: LIS-DXB: Lisbon check-in was terrible. They even charged 6 kg (over 40 ridiculous) extra weight (at Euros48 per kg). Had to queue 50 min to pay them at a special counter with unprepared and unpleasant staff. Probably a gift for my 1st trip on EK. Boarding: total mess for all classes. No smile. Food wine and staff on board extremely pleasant. Brand new B777-300ER. Nice clean. DXB-KIX the opposite: fast boarding uneatable food very regular wines and no smile from staff except 1. Planes late on departure and arrival in both cases. no free Wi-fi in DXB. ICE great anyway. Flat bed is Ok.,5,28th February 2014,Brazil
2241,Emirates A380 Sydney to Auckland economy returning business using points. Excellent service although the economy breakfast left a little to be desired. Great IFE using Emirate's ICE system. All in all a pleasant experience.,1,28th February 2014,Australia
2242,Sydney - Christchurch - Sydney. The flight over was acceptable with service pretty poor only one choice left out of two for the meal only one side of the sound in my headphones for IFE worked. Seats were cramped and uncomfortable. Flight back was poor. Flight was an hour late departing although they made up a lot of that time. Staff are quite rude tending to order you around and not showing much interest in customer comfort. My seat had a great big lump in the back like a spring had come loose or something. It was very uncomfortable. I told the FA who wasn't very interested but said she'd see if anything else was available after we took off. I told her I'd like to sit with my wife and she said 'its only a couple of hours so put up with it. It was so uncomfortable I'm not sure what I would have done if it had been a longer haul. food was OK had a choice this time IFE OK.,10,28th February 2014,Australia
2243,EK842 DOH-DXB + EK075 DXB-CDG - Very disappointing flights experience with Emirates. Lounge in DOH + Boarding error in DXB + Seat broken on A380 + On board service I could not escape the unpleasant experiences. Even the cabin crew usually smiling were unpleasant on both sectors and on DXB-CDG made mistakes in bar service. My seat was broken on A380 DXB-CDG sector and didn't work at all on a fully booked flight… It's not the 1st time this year.,8,27th February 2014,France
2244,"Economy B777-300ER from Manchester to Perth via Dubai. What a pleasant surprise when boarding at Manchester. The seat pitch was far more than I expected I am 5'8"" and there was more than enough room to stretch out. Yes the seats are narrow but I personally didn't find that to be a problem. The entertainment was ICE and not wide screen which was a disappointment as there wasn't as much on offer to watch as advertised. The food was great and the crew very attentive. Upon boarding at Dubai the IFE this time was ice wide screen and what a difference - absolutely superb. There was so much to choose from! Again the seating was great and the service first class. Return leg was the same routing. Only 84 passengers from Perth to Dubai so we were All able to stretch out and have a row each to ourselves. Older entertainment system again though. Return to Manchester was packed. Even more updated entertainment which huge screens hand held touchscreen device and a brilliant selection. Tip - if you're travelling economy on this type of aircraft try and get in the first section of economy as there's less people the no one walks past and no queue for the toilet. Avoid row 21 though as that is the last row of that cabin section and you do get people waiting for the toilet there. We had row 18 and 19ABC and they were great seats. I will definitely fly Emirates again.",10,27th February 2014,United Kingdom
2245,EK 215 and EK 823. LAX-DXB and DXB-DMM. Pleasantly surprised was dreading this flight back because of the bad experience I had during the inbound flight. It wasn't a full flight and I had all 3 seats to myself so could lie down made the 16hours leg comfortable. Plenty of drink runs and the food was very good albeit a small quantity but it was spaced well so I wasn't hungry throughout. Attendants were attentive but some seemed disinterested and cabin service can get disorganized at times. ICE was great but did not use much and noticed its the same contents as before. Seemed like catering out of DXB was of poorer quality hence the return from LAX is better. Transit at DXB was good arrived in the evening so not a lot of people. DXB-DMM was a hit and miss food was very good or a 1 hour flight but cabin crew was very disorganized and always on a rush. Landing smooth and communication from the cockpits was ok. All in all was a much better flight than the previous one I had.,2,27th February 2014,United States
2246,EK 313 and EK 312 - 17th Feb and 22nd Feb 2014. I've done 2 flights in the last week with Emirates 1 in Business and 1 in Economy and I have to say it's been very hit and miss with the service and food served. The Economy flight DXB to Tokyo and the return was in Business. Funny thing was the Economy journey was better reasonable food and service. The seats were good for Economy class decent pitch and leg room etc. The service in Business seemed very disorganized and slow and the food was very average. The seats I found very narrow and carried the vibrations of people walking past and the person next to me moving around. We were delayed nearly 5 hours on-route because of fog in Dubai which is not the airlines fault of course but a lack of communicating left everyone wondering what was going on. I was very surprised overall by the quality of the business experience. I'll be sticking with Qantas!,10,26th February 2014,Australia
2247,My wife and I flew EK414 etd Dubai 0150 in January 2014. This is a direct flight Dubai to Sydney on the A380. The business seats on the Emirates A380 appear roomy until you actually sit in one when you realize that the arrangement of everything around you actually quite crowds you. The extension of the food and beverage tray leaves very little room to move. The bed is actually a flat bed but the shoulder room is too squashed even for the average sized person that I am. This made it difficult to get any reasonable sleep. The hostess insisted on keeping the shutters down for the full 14 hours of the flight as we travelled from night to day and then into the night. I think that this contributed to our very first experience of jet lag and we have done quite a bit of travelling. The business class bar is wasted space.,7,25th February 2014,Australia
2248,My wife and I flew on EK419 etd Sydney 1845 last September. The first leg on this B777 took us to Bangkok the second leg was to Dubai. Out of Sydney we tried to get some sleep and the hostess provided us with a thin mattress each for the flat but reclining bed. This initially seemed comfortable but we both awoke to find that we had slipped down the bed towards the footrest. On the second leg we dispensed with the mattress and we both had some good sleep. The reclining bed proved to be surprisingly comfortable and there is plenty of shoulder room to turn over in.,3,25th February 2014,Australia
2249,As we checked in at London Gatwick for Emirates flight EK0016 we were told the flight was delayed 1 hour advised that there were around '30 of us' so there would probably be ground staff waiting for us to escort us to the connecting gate. We asked whilst in the air if we would make the connecting flight and were told we would arrive at 1am and therefore would have plenty of time to make our way to the connecting gate. Arrived at the airport disembarked and were met by ground staff at 1.40am who advised us the connecting flight had already left. We were sat in the connecting flight area while our baggage claim tickets were taken from us advised that they needed to rebook our flights. When we were given meal vouchers at 2.20am I asked how long we would be waiting for they couldn't give a time. Told we would be on the 9.55am Qantas flight to Sydney QF002. Given a hotel voucher and advised we needed to be back 2 hours before the flight to check-in. 5 hours at the hotel did not seem worth the hassle and we asked if we could instead use the Emirates lounge told no to this request. We finally got to the hotel at 4.30am. When we finally arrived back at Dubai airport to check in to our rebooked flight we were told that as it was an almost full flight there were no seats next to each other left and that we would be sitting in separate aisles and middle seats. We did not pay extra money to be on a flight that arrived at a convenient time in Sydney only to have this ordeal happen to us and to be put on a full flight where we could not even sit next to the person we booked our flight with. Our dietary requirements were not carried over to the next flight we were not given an apology for this or an alternative solution. other airline would have provided.,10,21st February 2014,Australia
2250,Outbound EK0062 from HAM-DXB (Aug 2nd 2013) and EK0372 from DXB-BKK (Aug 3rd 2013). Inbound EK0373 from BKK-DXB (Jan 23rd 2014) and EK0061 from DXB-HAM (Jan 24th 2014). Entertainment system is above everything else I have tried. The food and drink options are the best I have tried in Economy. They offered juice and water multiple times after food was served and if you turned on your lights the staff came right away. On my way home I had a few hours to spend in Dubai and one of the attendant took a lot of time to tell me about Dubai - what to see transportation how much money to exchange etc. Overall I more felt I was flying business than Economy.,10,20th February 2014,Denmark
2251,Flew MAN-DXB-KUL and return flew on the new A380 the first leg and was very impressed with the seating meal and drink service plane only 1/2 full. Staff very friendly and efficient. The second leg was on the 777 to Melbourne Via KL. What a horrible journey seating was very tight and plane was full to capacity. Service onboard was not good at all food was bad and the drinks service only came once. Staff seemed to be more intent on chatting in the galley than actually serving the passengers. The return was no better from DXB to MAN but plane was not even half full so this made it a bit more bearable. Why does Emirates insist on over crowding the 777. Will only fly Emirates if the journey is on the A380.,10,20th February 2014,United Kingdom
2252,Economy on EK405 (codeshare Qantas as QF8405) from Melbourne to Singapore on 19 Feb 2014. Emirates sent a B777-300 that was an older version without ICE digital but IMHO it is still much better than those found on Qantas A330-300s. The flight was operating below capacity hence most passengers had an entire row to themselves. Service staff ok dinner decent and entertainment options were very good. All in all a generally good flight to Singapore - nothing special but definitely not horrible. Worth flying again for the price paid.,4,20th February 2014,Singapore
2253,Flight EK 384 from Bangkok to Hong Kong on Feb 13th 2014. The flight was delayed for almost an hour. However they did arrive in Hong Kong 20 minutes late. The food and beverage was great and plentiful. The IFE good and the seat was comfortable for a short flight.,9,19th February 2014,Thailand
2254,Flight EK 385 from Hong Kong to Bangkok on Feb 15th 2014. The flight left and arrived on time. The food and beverage was OK except coffee and tea was not served due to time constraints. IFE and seat was good.,1,19th February 2014,Thailand
2255,BHX to CMB and back. The first flight to CMB was awful we had to wait 2 hours more then expected I had a baby and my son with me and they did not offer my children any meals or food for the whole flight. My son was upset because he did not receive the small backpack with colouring pencils and a colouring book (which you normally get for kids). The return flight however was pleasant we did get food this time and the crew was friendly! We paid enough money for the ticket so I hope next time will be a lot better on both flights.,1,18th February 2014,United Kingdom
2256,Flew Manchester to Tokyo Haneda with transit in Dubai. Both planes 777. Was very happy to be upgraded from business to first between MAN and DXB. The free car service to/from airport was excellent. EK's lounge at MAN is world class - a full free buffet restaurant and excellent showers with full hotel style towel pack on request. The business lounge at DXB also very good: full free buffet restaurant service. Quite full but so many seats that there was no problem in finding somewhere comfortable to sit. MAN-DXB: service in almost empty first cabin was exceptional with stunning food and extremely comfortable private seat. DXB-HND: business seats a tad narrow but long offering a fair degree of privacy and slept well with the additional mattress provided. Food and service both extremely good. Plane was a little old and sad and would have benefited from small repairs and adjustments to fittings but everything worked and was very clean. I fly EK reasonably often but can always find new content on the excellent ICE AV system. The Emirates' Saver Business ticket represented extremely good value even without the upgrade to first several hundred pounds cheaper than European carriers with the plus of free car service included.,10,17th February 2014,Japan
2257,Flew BKK-SYD on Feb 7th. Business class lounge closed for refurbishment. Very shocked at the low standard of the substitute Qantas lounge - extremely average. Cheap wine and almost no food. Business class cabin was full. Dinner service on overnight flight was average. No amenities kit on 9+ hour overnight flight. Surprisingly second rate IFE - no comparison with premium routes. Breakfast was continental - it consisted of fruit dry croissant and coffee. Overall this was an extremely average experience. The seats are fine so great for sleeping but the service and product beyond that are non-existent.,1,13th February 2014,Australia
2258,DMM-DXB and DXB-LAX. DMM-LAX: flight attendants look as if they don't want to be there delayed flight due to late turn around of the plane. A general sense of being disorganized. Good: ICE system and fruit meal for an hour flight. DXB airport is too crowded just too many people. DXB-LAX: full flight with very little service throughout. Only one drinks service call light largely ignored. Food was poor and service was an eternity only one full meal. Snacks were not served. Seats are uncomfortable. Good: few FAs were attentive toilets were clean and ICE system was good. Overall: not a good flight. I'm not looking forward to my return flight.,3,12th February 2014,United States
2259,Flew a 777 Adelaide-Dubai-Istanbul - Reasonable service but very slow. The A380 return flight Amsterdam-Dubai - service was shocking. We had finished our entrée and were still waiting for a glass of wine! We had finished our main course and were still waiting for a glass of wine. I will never fly Emirates again. We went Emirates because they fly direct from Adelaide and they were a ONE WORLD affiliate but next time we go overseas (Europe in June 2015) we will go to Sydney or Melbourne and fly Qantas!,10,12th February 2014,Australia
2260,Business class BKK to SYD - I felt like I was inconveniencing the flight attendant. The food was very ordinary but it was the service that was woeful. The flight attendant allocated to our seats was rude whenever we asked for anything. No comfort kit. My tray of food was taken away that quickly and with that little eye contact that it was not possible to ask for another drink. SYD to BKK was acceptable but not as good as it was a few years ago.,10,10th February 2014,Australia
2261,Ek419 SYD-DXB 25/11/13. EK005 DXB-LHR 29/11/13. Ek026 GLA-DXB 13/1/14. EK412 DXB-SYD 14/1/14. Very poor service. Glasgow to Sydney: It was 3 hours before they offered the first drink I was thirsty so asked for a drink before take off after that I was still thirsty so I pressed my button for assistance but no one came. It wasn't until after the meals came around 3 hours into the flight that I got offered a drink. The breakfast options were both egg options so if you don't like egg you are not getting a meal.,9,10th February 2014,Australia
2262,Flew from Mumbai to JFK via Dubai on February 4th this year in coach/economy. The cabin crew seemed very disinterested. The seat was broken and I had to repair it myself on the Mumbai to Dubai (Flt 509) leg of the journey. The overnight portion of the trip (Dubai to JFK Flt 203) was very unpleasant principally due to the over abundance of passengers traveling with young children who screamed the entire flight. It was impossible to read or watch a movie. The flight attendants simply didn't want to be bothered.,1,10th February 2014,United States
2263,Travelled business class EK 379 from Phuket to Dubai and EK 025 the next day from Dubai to Glasgow on Feb 1. Phuket Airport was very busy and the business class lounge operated by a local company was awful. We were chaperoned from check in desk to this lounge bypassing the long queues which was very helpful. Overnight flight. The flat bed was not very comfortable but I saw on the next flight a mattresses being provided. These were not on offer but may have made a big difference. The limousine service at Dubai and Glasgow were excellent. The flight to Glasgow was also on time and very comfortable. The food was average and poorly presented.,5,10th February 2014,United Kingdom
2264,Travelled Business Class on EK 028 Glasgow to Dubai connecting to EK 378 Dubai to Phuket on Jan 14. Both flights were excellent with on time take off and landing. Limo collection most helpful. Glasgow business class lounge is poor. The food on both sectors was ordinary. The food presentation was pretty poor.,8,10th February 2014,United Kingdom
2265,Flew WAW-DXB on old A330 aircraft. The business class seat was not fully reclining but was still very comfortable. The inflight entertainment was old and needed updating. Many channels couldn't be accessed and the ones that were had functional text (eg volume brightness) on the screen which couldn't be removed. The service and food was excellent though they did forget to serve us our cheese and biscuits. They were very apologetic about that and managed to serve it literally 15 mins before landing.,5,10th February 2014,Poland
2266,Auckland-Melbourne-Dubai-Amsterdam. I wasn't really convinced about the quality of the airline. The good things were the in-flight entertainment and the food. However service was very poor with flight attendants not really knowing what they're doing. Disorganised team of 20-30 year olds. Will definitely choose Singapore Airlines or one of the other Asian carriers again next time!,5,10th February 2014,New Zealand
2267,Routing was FRA-DXB on a B777 new configuration with suites in First class. Plenty of space excellent food and drinks 20 year old Bordeaux wine premium whiskeys. The suite is spacious and you can close the door for privacy. Return flight was business class also in a B-777 as usual good service and good food. First time in the new lounge at Terminal 3 in Dubai which was also a good experience not so crowded as in the old Terminal and better atmosphere.,9,7th February 2014,Germany
2268,A380 flight from JFK - Dubai - Kuala Lumpur early in December 2013 with my wife and 3-year old son. 1st leg: JFK- Dubai-KL. On the JFK - Dubai route they flew the A380 which was nearly full. It was an 11 pm flight - the crew only began to start serving food 4-hrs after take-off! My son did not receive his complimentary inflight toy set they did give the toys out but ran out before reaching us. Always had to do a 'reminder' request for water or drinks! Dubai - KL route: they flew us in a very old A330 - flight was cramped and the seats smelt! The surface of my seat was worn out and torn. The air-conditioning and ventilation wasn't working before the flight and performed poorly in the air. Return leg (KL - Dubai): The A380 plane blacked-out when the plane was boarded and engineers had to come on board to fix the problem. During this time the plane was dark very stuffy no any offer from the crew to provide drinks. Lots of apologies from the captain though but the flight was delayed almost an hour.,8,7th February 2014,United States
2269,Seattle-Dubai-Sydney. Our flights from Sydney to Dubai to Seattle were mediocre. Customer Service was marginal in terms of FA attentiveness and politeness. Our son had a child's meal ordered and it was delivered 45 minutes before we were served our meal. While the A380 had a dedicated restroom attendant from Sydney to Dubai that was not the case on the 777-200ER on the Dubai to Seattle route. Two restrooms became inoperative during this flight and the remaining ones were filthy by the time we arrived in Seattle. The ICE entertainment system was the best feature of the flights. Good selection of movies/TV shows and News.,2,7th February 2014,United States
2270,Emirates used to be good 2 years ago. I flew from JFK to Bangladesh through Milan then Dubai (8 hours flight each way). It was a very uncomfortable 29 hours trip because the service was very poor. Coming back was 39 hours trip. When I pressed the call button staff no one came for the entire 8 hours flight (same for Bangladesh to Dubai). I had to get up and get the water myself after 90 minutes of waiting. I paid over $2.500 USD and it was not worth the money. The seats were so close together that the passenger next to me had to place his leg on my side just to fit into his seat. The only good thing I can say about my trip was that the food and entertainment system was good.,4,7th February 2014,United States
2271,JFK to Dubai-Lahore and Islamabad to Dubai-JFK. A380 to Dubai and 777-300 to Pakistan. All four flights completely filled to capacity. Meals were good service prompt and courteous. Sitting back in row 83 takes about 20 minutes until exiting the A380 after landing. The highlight is the Emirates ICE on-demand entertainment system. Obtained mileage accrual with partner airline JetBlue.,6,5th February 2014,United States
2272,DXB-BKK - Business. Upgraded with milesEK are pulling a fast one with Skywards members in that part of the biz class package is chauffeur pick up and drop. You must upgrade at the airport and hope there are seats which will cost you 45000 miles which is huge amount of miles for a simple seat upgrade. Staff were good to BKK on the A380 food as usual not good small portions menu offers soup etc its never given main course Birani again? Rice as a main in business class? Wines are being cut back. Overall average there and back entertainment good as ever. Return on 772-300 older model needs an upgrade its well over 10 years interiors and seat has seen better days with padding poor. Staff on this leg insisted that lights stay on full blast until 5 passengers complained that they wished to sleep as a 8 am Departure Senior refused until 4 hours into the flight.,1,5th February 2014,United Arab Emirates
2273,Nairobi to Manchester via DXB and back. Having loyally used Emirates for the last couple of years I am extremely disappointed with EK719 DXB-NRB flight back home on 3rd Feb. As if the discomfort was not enough the seat pockets were a shambles torn and hanging. An attendant loudly said to a passenger in response as to why he doesn't take flight meals I totally agree with you on this. This while serving the rest of us. Such a pity really.,10,5th February 2014,Kenya
2274,Perth to Dubai and then Dubai to Istanbul and return. Main problem is no water or drinks served until 4 hours into a 10.5 hr flight. Service awful. On board entertainment broken for one entire 10.5 hour leg of flight. Really terrible experience. Food was inedible apart from a salad on one of the legs.,8,5th February 2014,Australia
2275,DUB-PER 23/1/14 QF8424. Plane old and dirty - disorganised boarding people in my seat refusing to move as they wanted to sit together requiring cabin crew to intervene. In flight entertainment not working. No food or drinks service until nearly 4 hours in to a 10 hour flight. Food served poor quality and cold. When asking for a glass of wine and water cabin crew initially refused saying one drink only (only drinks offered during the 2 meal services). Seat pocket broken. Would not not not recommend unless they upgrade the planes going in to Perth.,8,4th February 2014,United Kingdom
2276,"The first class ""service"" on this Auckland-Melbourne flight was atrocious and for the money I paid totally unacceptable. Food service was chaotic - I had to ask for bread wine and salad dressing was offered with dessert! The person sitting next to me almost didn't get any dinner at all because nobody took her order. No tea or coffee was offered after dinner and repeated calls to flight attendants were ignored. They didn't seem to know what they were doing and spent most of the flight hanging around in the galley area chatting. The good news? Very comfortable seats and great inflight entertainment but they didn't compensate for some of the worst service (any class any airline) I have ever experienced. I'm going back to Singapore Airlines.",8,4th February 2014,Australia
2277,Singapore-Melbourne B777. I've previously said I'd never fly with them again but this time I had no choice so I owe them an update. The flight was OK food wasn't outstanding. Breakfast was awful. I always find Emirates staff and service to be inconsistent across sectors. The ICE entertainment system is very good and there's lots to choose from. The planes are always modern and clean. I prefer Etihad for the food and service and just Emirates for the entertainment.,6,3rd February 2014,United Kingdom
2278,EK 407 AKL-MEL First Class A380-800. First class cabin crew seemed very disorganised inattentive uninterested and lacking proper management. Pre-flight drinks (champagne only no juice no water) were offered to some pax but not others snack baskets missing from some suites several calls to flight attendants ignored no pre-dinner drinks offered. Menu and wine list given but no dinner order taken until I eventually attracted someone's attention and by then it was almost too late. No duty free order taken complicated seat adjustment/entertainment controls not explained despite requests customs forms handed out only after final descent. In order to get anyone's attention (call button was repeatedly ignored) I went back to the galley to find the flight attendants sitting around giggling and gossiping. Very sloppy and unprofessional and not what I pay a First Class fare for.,5,3rd February 2014,Australia
2279,29th Jan Dubai to Perth. Took an hour to check in and drop bags. Plane delayed an hour without telling passengers. Everyone was herded into a tiny departure room so we could wait in discomfort. Had booked kids meals they didn't arrive. Staff stormed off and came back with kids meals. Rest of the food was some of the worst dried out pasta scrambled eggs with the consistency of mashed potato for breakfast. Asked for another drink it never came. Overnight flight included the cabin screens flashing bright white every 20 mins. 25 Jan London to Dubai. Same carry on with kids meals. Very average service and food. Had to wait 40 minutes for bags after we had cleared passport control. Very disappointed.,10,31st January 2014,Australia
2280,Sydney to Dubai. Treated myself to a Miles upgrade. What an experience. Huge individual pod pyjamas duvet and mattress. Kruger and Leuwin to drink caviar a long comfortable sleep - then a shower. A real treat.,2,31st January 2014,United Kingdom
2281,Heathrow to Perth and Dubai to Heathrow. A really good experience I cannot fault anything other than the cost. A380 is a joy upstairs and the quality in the 777 Business contrasts with the below average and cramped economy.,1,31st January 2014,United Kingdom
2282,Flew LHR-DXB return in January of this year. Seat on A380 spacious and comfortable ICE system great toilets clean flights largely on time. Only problem is the dreadful cabin crew. So disorganised and slow when serving meals. Took 2 hours on the LHR-DXB flight to be offered a drink. In the end I went up to the galley area where the crew were just chatting and asked for water. Meal was served 3 hours into a 6 hour night flight so no one got any sleep. Not a single drinks run after that. Service truly appalling compared to airlines like Singapore airlines. Also no comfort kit was provided - socks toothbrush etc which I suppose is a minor thing. Return flight was better as there was one drinks run. Still not great though. Wouldn't choose to fly with them again.,3,31st January 2014,United Kingdom
2283,EK432 Singapore-Brisbane 25/1/2014. Having flown international business class many times on several airlines this trip can only be rated as the worst experience my wife and I have had in either economy class or business class. Staff were unhelpful and obviously unsuited to their job. From check-in to the final getting off the aircraft was one of poor service. The white wine I was served after takeoff was warm the lamb I ordered for my meal was overcooked and almost inedible the entertainment system was awkward to use and no instructions on how to use it were supplied. The flight attendant asked us after take off whether we were familiar with the entertainment system and when we replied no she said she would come back and explain she never came back! I will never fly Emirates again.,1,31st January 2014,Australia
2284,This was our first time flying to Perth Australia via Dubai with Emirates what a pleasant experience. Staff very attentive and economy class was very comfortable. I was dreading the long flights but found watching a couple of movies on each flight passed the time and two meals on each flight where acceptable and complementary drinks was a nice touch. Will definitely use this airline again good value for money.,2,30th January 2014,United Kingdom
2285,My 13 year old recently flew as an unaccompanied minor with Emirates on a return trip from Perth Australia to Glasgow (via Dubai). He arrived back in Perth with us yesterday and I have to say I have been very impressed with this service from start to finish. We were naturally dubious about him flying alone at first but Emirates were organised efficient and professional. They even upgraded him to first class for one leg of the trip. I would have no hesitation using this service again if need be.,1,29th January 2014,Australia
2286,12 Dec 2013 Flight EK004 from LHR. Staff on Emirates flight from London to Dubai are getting worse. They ignored both my children (5 and 8 years old) no toys. They did not have the ordered meals for the children. Head steward claimed I had not ordered them but I had proof that I had ordered them. These are A380 flight crew - what is the point in getting a new flight when the staff cannot meet the basics needs of passengers.,8,28th January 2014,United Kingdom
2287,I have flown with Emirates on 8 occasions (Economy) and the flight from Dubai to Gatwick on December 29th 2013 will be the last I have given the airline the benefit of doubt for too long already. Their prices are sky high and the service on board is chaotic. The staff are friendly enough but uncoordinated. The last 3 times they ran out of the meal I would have preferred. Flying out to Dubai this Christmas it was 3.5 hours into the flight before we received a meal at all and it was cold. On yet another flight they forgot to serve regular meals (those not pre-booked) to the whole block of seats from the rearward bulkhead onward. On a new A380 a couple of years ago I flew to Dubai from Heathrow with part of the ceiling flapping about above my head. On 2 occasions the ICE entertainment system was faulty. My main complaint though is with the poor cabin service.,8,28th January 2014,United Kingdom
2288,Travelled business class on EK434 23 Jan and EK435 26 Jan BNE-AKL-BNE (A380-800). Consistently good service on both flights with attentive crew and impressive product. Seats very comfortable and would definitely make for a pleasant long haul flight. IFE boasts extensive selection of movie/music/TV options. Bar lounge is a terrific space to stretch one's legs and socialise with others. Food a little basic for business class standards and some crew lacked wine knowledge but this didn't really impact too much on the overall experience. Our travel agent ordered a surprise cake for us to celebrate our impending marriage and the crew made a fuss even taking a Polaroid picture for us to commemorate the occasion - such a lovely gesture all round! Would not hesitate to fly EK again in the future.,8,28th January 2014,Australia
2289,"I flew with my wife in Business class this month from Manchester to Dubai and then changed for another Emirates flight to Singapore. We returned some 7 days later 4 flights with Emirates 3 on the A380 and one on a 777-300. The seats on the A380 are fully flat but so narrow only 18.5"" (basically an economy class seat that goes flat) and not very comfortable. The 777 seats are a bit wider 20.5"" but not full flat. The cabin service on all 4 flights was awful they have so many different nationalities that clearly do not work well together and they have no real interest in the passengers. They are not organised never smile and do not seem to know what they are doing. Dubai airport itself is a disaster chaotic no helpful ground staff. One of the Business Class lounges was OK but the other one in the older Terminal I think was dirty and run down. We paid over £4500 for the flights I feel really hard done by.",5,25th January 2014,United Kingdom
2290,Flew JNB-DXB-LHR. Excellent service and amazing selection of the latest movies and TV series. Both aircraft's (777-300er and A380) were brand new and very comfortable. I have flown this route many times and will always look for a deal with Emirates before looking elsewhere as I know that I can expect the best.,10,24th January 2014,United Kingdom
2291,JNB to SEA via DXB 8 hours to DXB 4 hrs transfer time in DXB plus 14.5 hrs DXB-SEA. Overall impression is very good as I arrived in SEA feeling OK and managed a full day of activities despite the nearly 30 hours spent travelling. Flight from JNB-DXB was very full with a few strange seat allocations by ground staff resulting in seat shuffle for many passengers in the Biz cabin so families could sit together etc. Service and food was good although a little rushed; presumably to maximise sleep-time on this 8hr flight. ICE system required re-setting once but then worked well. Staff remembered not to wake me as requested and I was woken with 30min to landing and still offered a quick croissant and yoghurt which was appreciated. 7/10 for this flight overall. Dubai lounge was impressive in terms of size and space although I skipped breakfast. Lounge could possibly do with a few more private areas. I boarded the DXB-SEA flight dreading the 15-odd hours of further flying but this turned out to be a fantastic flight. Half-empty in Biz with professional friendly and chatty crew and a real step up in meal quality over the previous night's flight. I spent the flight alternating between the food and drink sleeping and the huge selection on the entertainment system. I was particularly impressed with their music choice. Only negative comment on the ICE system is that while the size and clarity of the screens are great the screens are so big that it can be very distracting if someone is sitting next to you and watching the TV as well. No such issues on the DXB-SEA flight as I was alone in a pair of seats but seating mishaps on the full JNB-DXB flight meant I had two huge screens from my neighbours as well as mine to contend with when trying to watch a movie. Overall very happy with my experience as it made the extra-long trip very manageable.,2,24th January 2014,United Kingdom
2292,DXB-MAN Jan 2014. Dubai lounge again was very satisfactory stunning array of food and beverages on offer and very busy for all the early morning wave. Boarding on time and direct to aircraft from lounge via a lift. Upper deck boarding via air bridge. Crew friendly and welcoming on the whole some perhaps just business friendly. Menu for flight looks far more enticing than previous sectors. Extremely friendly and efficient steward from Dubai himself was looking after me. Very attentive throughout. Seat again is fantastic but this time a LH window seat with minibar to the window and seat more to the aisle - does not feel as private. Under window stowage is also hard to access. Variety of appetisers and sweets at the bar was great on this sector and the Manchester born girl manning the bar was chatty and genuine. Skipped breakfast and snacked at the bar on and off. Dinner service before arriving in Manchester was lovely Nice soup Beef Steak and a Cheese board to finish. Best meal in 4 flights so far and probably the nicest crew . Overall impression of Emirates after a 4 leg trip aircraft well kept A380 stands out 777-300 are getting overhauled crew attentive and professional and immaculately turned out. Food and beverages - food quite average to be honest only 1 dish got me excited. Choice of drinks good with good quality wines too. Entertainment systems are impressive but found content lacking in comparison with Cathay Pacific and BA. Punctuality was good with only minimal delays on departures at times.,2,23rd January 2014,United Kingdom
2293,DXB-BKK Jan 2014. Business lounge impressive at Dubai shower facilities clean and spacious. Food and beverage offer good also. Direct lounge to boarding gate access via lift. Older Boeing 777-300 showing its age but still clean and Business cabin well presented. Very friendly and attentive crew through out. Red eye service lights kept nice and dim throughout after take off snack and supper menu was nice - deli sandwich fresh. Inflight entertainment system functionality impressive but lacking in good movie or tv choice. Breakfast prior to landing was decisively average and serving method seems very bitty. On time arrival into Bangkok.,1,23rd January 2014,United Kingdom
2294,MAN-DXB-MAN. Business Lounge was ok nice breakfast. Boarding gate quite a walk from the lounge - T1 pier at Manchester basic and clinical feeling. Boeing 777-300ER was clean and Business cabin was well presented. Crew professional and well groomed - Business friendly. Boarding drinks service promptly after seated. Departure on- time after take off drinks order taken - delivered 1 hour later. Excuse stock in economy. Two meal services Breakfast (average) and Dinner before landing (Ok). Not overly impressed with the quality and taste of the dishes. Attentiveness of crew throughout the flight good Inflight entertainment functionally impressive but choice of films and tv poor. Toilets clean and well stocked. Seat very good fully lie flat with massage function - privacy could be improved. On time arrival into Dubai.,7,23rd January 2014,United Kingdom
2295,Traveled DXB-DAR-DXB on Boeing 777-300. Crew was friendly but responded to call after 2 hours. The entertainment system was ICE and had millions of movies and TV Shows to last you a year let alone a 5 hour flight. Seats were comfy but less legroom. Food was excellent no complaints. Overall I really enjoyed Emirates and would recommend it to anyone.,4,23rd January 2014,Canada
2296,Flights EK412 and 410 between Auckland and Australia. As an airline they are OK - but nothing special. Cabin crew not that good. Have had much better service on cheaper airlines. The A380 economy seats are better than some airlines narrower seats. Boarding and getting off the A380 is a real pain so slow! Maybe its part airport problem also - but it will need fixing. Movie selection large. Not good value for money.,3,23rd January 2014,New Zealand
2297,BKK-DXB Jan 2014. Bangkok Emirates lounge ancient tiny and poorly laid out. Food and beverage choice was however very good. Boarding gate minutes+ from lounge. A380 upper deck boarding via air bridge. Very friendly and welcoming crew they seem to love the A380 and explaining its features to passengers actively inviting you to come for a drink in the lounge bar. Impressive seat as anticipated comfortable and spacious with good privacy. Mini bar at seat is a nice touch but nobody wants to drink warm pepsi or fruit juice when you can get a more refreshing drink at the touch of a button or walk to the bar. Massive screen but I remain un-impressed with the range of films and TV programmes on offer. Red eye service cabin lights nice and dim throughout the flight. Full dining service offered despite the 1am departure time with a breakfast served before arrival. Skipped the meal had drinks and canapés at the bar. Nice feature of the Emirates A380 but bar seems to have little space for stock and they constantly run out of things and the poor crew are backwards and forwards from the galley constantly. Lie flat bed was extremely comfortable more so than the 777-300ER beds and combined with the seat liner and nice blankets it was brilliant. Best sleep ever on long haul. Breakfast prior to arrival was decisively average yet again tried the cold cuts and cheese as had enough of the hot offerings and the meat was off poor quality with tasteless cheese. Arrival into Dubai as on time. Very pleasant experience overall A380 is spacious luxurious and a smooth quiet ride on upper deck.,1,23rd January 2014,United Kingdom
2298,FRA-PER via DXB Dec 2013. Seating comfort was very poor and comparable to a cheap charter airline. Cabin Service was as poor as the seating. The crew were uninterested and unfriendly to the passengers. One FA was not able to form a complete sentence when he asked after the passengers wish (Chicken? Beef? Coffee?). FA call signs were generally ignored. If you want a bottle of water you had to proceed to the galley. This was our first and last flight with Emirates.,1,22nd January 2014,Germany
2299,Flew 2 way from JFK-Dubai-Manila last Nov Jan respectively. The A380 was a nice airplane with decent seats but the inflight service was underwhelming. The serving of the food was very disorganised and meal selections were always not available. The attendants were serving the coffee/tea at the same time they were serving the meal and beverage. Flight attendants were ignoring flight attendant call signal/buttons. I was disappointed thinking that the flight to Manila via Dubai would be better as the fare was more expensive and longer. The inflight services on flights via Asian routes are much much better no comparison.,2,21st January 2014,Canada
2300,"Flew SYD-DXB-GRU-DXB-SYD in December and January. I am a Qantas Gold Frequent Flyer and had originally booked Economy but I upgraded to Business for the first leg and then received further upgrades on subsequent flights. Second time I have flown Emirates and was very impressed. Easy check-in in Sydney and Sao Paulo and transit in Dubai very easy. Found all staff both inflight and on ground extremely friendly and helpful. Meals on all flights were excellent with a wide variety of choices - all accompanied by some excellent wines. The ICE - entertainment system offered incredibly varied options of entertainment. My only complaint was the angled lie flat bed on the B777-300 - I have a real thing about angled lie flat bed. Luggage arrived quickly and the ""Priority"" tag seemed if it actually meant something with Emirates - I am sure it is for appearance factor only on other airlines. Overall the flights were highly enjoyable relaxing and I would definitely use Emirates again.",7,21st January 2014,Australia
2301,EK005 7th Jan Business class with my wife and two boys aged 7 and 4. Very disappointing. The pre-ordered children's meals were not available! I was told by the FA that they had been given to other children. Why were there not sufficient meals on board? I can understand if an adult choice is not available but an airline of this supposed stature should not do this. The adult choices were spicy or containing beef which we do not eat. When I complained the FA giggled and offered me a drink! The service was disorganised and awful. I will avoid Emirates in the future!,3,20th January 2014,United Kingdom
2302,"Travelled London to New Zealand via Dubai and Sydney. Inflight entertainment was superb but unfortunately that's about the only positive thing I can say about the airline. Of the half dozen requests made to the in flight staff all were turned down and we're not talking about anything special. Examples such as; ""can I have a new set of headphones these don't work"" ""can you please fix my screen as it won't turn on"". Food service was shambolic children's meals being sent out up to an hour before the rest of the service crew walking around randomly with a couple of trays looking for people repeated offers to give me a child's meal even though I had never asked for one! So inefficient. Once the main service started the crew constantly ran out of options condiments bread rolls etc. because they were blocking the aisles for so long people who had been served wanted to use the rest rooms and the crew didn't want to let them past and didn't want to clear up the children's trays which in some cases were there from 2 hours before. Having the inflight entertainment interrupted for Emirates advertising is pretty irritating too especially when you are trying to settle children down who don't want a seat belt on pre take off. Lastly - would it hurt the crew to treat the passengers like customers? Smile respond to passenger calls and don't stand around the galleys gossiping. Won't be flying myself and family again and wouldn't recommend Emirates.",5,20th January 2014,United Kingdom
2303,HAM-DXB-HAM with B777. As always EK flight was fairly pleasant even when both flights have been packed. Entertainment system is second to none space and food better than with all European airlines. Service good both flights have been more or less in time. Check in procedure efficient. Unfortunately this time it happens to me that the stewardess spilled some coffee over my sweater. She felt very embarrassed and apologised with champagne from biz class.,10,17th January 2014,Germany
2304,The 777 kills it. The expected A380 between Kuala Lumpur and Dubai was switched a few day ago for the Boeing 777. What a let down. Yes the A380 is great but the seating on most 777s does not provide enough space and I am a normal shape. The idea of sitting at an angle or hugging the next guy for 7 hours does not appeal to me enough to change airline which will offer me a wider seat. The 777 is a gold mine for the airline but not suited too narrow for an extra seat.,8,17th January 2014,Malaysia
2305,We flew Sydney - Dublin return and it was underwhelming to say the least. The service on board was very poor meals were rushed and it took over an hour and two requests to get a glass of water on more than one occasion. The cabin crew were at best not very friendly with some being extremely rude. Passengers who needed to use the washroom during the meal service were told by one crew member to wait until after the service or they would not get back to their seat.,5,17th January 2014,Australia
2306,I flew Ho Chi Minh City transiting in Dubai to London Heathrow. I usually fly Thai because it's the fastest route by far but the recent political protests in BKK made me think it was probably unwise to transit through Bangkok at the moment. I was deeply disappointed with the seat on the HCMC to Dubai leg of the journey. I was expecting one of those not quite flat angled seat beds but it wasn't even that. The 777-200 on that route is just a reclining seat. Since the flight leaves at 00.40 in the morning I was hoping to get at least some sleep before Dubai. I fly business class to get the sleep. I might as well have flown economy. The food was very mediocre as well. However staff were very nice. The business class lounge in Dubai is excellent. I can't praise it highly enough. The food is great the showers are wonderful and the staff are friendly and helpful. The second leg of the journey was on the A380 the seat was lovely - a fully flat bed in one of those little cubicles. Unfortunately this leg of the trip was during daylight hours so everyone was being very noisy and so despite the bed I couldn't get any sleep and arrived exhausted. The food on this leg of the journey was perfectly okay. The staff were all polite but strangely distracted and not terribly co-ordinated on this leg. The wait between first course and main was about 40 minutes. Very odd. I don't know if anyone from Emirates every reads these things but if they do - could you please put earplugs in the amenity kits? All in all I'd say that although Thai planes are a little older and shabbier the cabin crew are better trained and co-ordinated the food is better the seats may not be totally lie flat but at least you get to lie down on the flights. And most importantly they always give you ear plugs.,1,16th January 2014,Vietnam
2307,Recently flown Emirates while on holiday with my family to Singapore and Sydney from New Zealand. I have very specific requirements when traveling due to using an electric wheelchair for mobility. Despite emailing the airline in advance with these requirements I had a distressing experience using this airline. It was awful from check-in to landing. The customer service was terrible at the check-in desk. The Emirates crew at Sydney airport were unfriendly and they were more interested in talking amongst themselves. At check-in I explained that I'd like to drive my wheelchair up to the entrance of the plane. Check-in staff made a lot of calls and eventually they assured me they were happy with my request. Having reached the gate with my family the bad service continued. The lady at the gate was surprised to see me and asked why I wasn't in a transit chair. She refused to process my boarding early. She ignored my explanation regarding my wheelchair and brought out a transit chair for me to transfer into. When I refused she made more calls and finally she allowed my family and I to continue toward the entrance of the plane. On board usually when a passenger with a disability is onboard a Cabin Service Manager (CSM) comes to say “hello”and make sure all is OK. I was totally ignored. The food was terrible to say the least. Flight attendants did not seem interested in passengers. When we landed I had to wait for other passengers to get off first. Once the cabins were cleared I was told that a chair was on its way. 15 minutes later she showed us to a transit chair. My heart sank. I asked where my chair was and I asked that it be brought to the entrance of the plane instead. I pointed out to her that she clearly saw me board the plane with my chair and I was requesting the same procedure to happen in order for me to get off the plane. Within a few minutes my chair was brought to the plane. What could have been a very simple problem to resolve turned out to be a nightmare. I am hesitant to travel with Emirates again.,7,15th January 2014,New Zealand
2308,Bangkok to Sydney departing 10/1/14 QF 8418. Very disappointing after all the hype. Check in was a long and tedious process and between my wife and I we were a couple of kilos over the checked baggage allowance and had to argue the toss for them to allow to 2 kilos over between the two of us. Boarding at Bangkok was confusing. The inflight service was not too bad except we were served breakfast missing the promised croissants and whe we brought this to the cabin crews attention they found two cold ones for us. We had to ask three times for our Sydney arrival cards to be given to us. The entertainment system is excellent. Following our first experience with Emirates would not recommend them as a first choice airline as there are better alternatives. Emirates is either expanding too fast or resting on its laurels.,10,15th January 2014,Australia
2309,MEL-KUL-DXB-DEL COK-DXB-KUL SIN-MEL (the latter-most operated by QF). Return ticket (AUD1250) was excellent value for money. One of the more noticeable (but unfortunate) features was the rather surly and cold service across all EK flights. Most attendants were not too friendly concentrating on mechanically serving their flights which were fully booked. However food and beverage was solid and entertainment was excellent. Some points about particular flights: The EK409 MEL-KUL-DXB flight was unusually full of large families with young children so be prepared for a screaming economy cabin if booking this flight I would hazard a guess. This is not ideal especially given that the flight leaves MEL a few hours after midnight when you'd want a sleep. EK give me an opportunity to upgrade my COK-DXB flight to business through email for AUD330 which I took up. It was an amazing experience (for someone who has never flown business before). Service (unlike the economy service) was very warm friendly without being overbearing and the food and drink was excellent and constant (I ordered extra bread and dessert brought out very willingly). One of the attendants even got out a staff camera to take a picture for me which was a nice touch to the flight as I had told them it was my first time on business class. EK346 DXB-KUL on the A380 didn't seem any different from other aircraft although the inflight wifi was a added bonus. Overall I'd recommend EK for the excellent price but don't expect tip-top Singapore Airlines-type service.,3,14th January 2014,Australia
2310,FRA-DXB / SIN-DXB / DXB-FRA. One of the most overrated airlines in my opinion. Seats and food okay but not more than average. Cabin crew far to young to provide professional service. All service rounds appeared quite disorganized and took ages. Crew friendly but more into interaction with themselves than with the passengers. It´ s a pity that QF is codesharing with this airline on the FRA-SYD route.,4,14th January 2014,Germany
2311,First Leg was SYD-DXB then DXB-DUB and return was LHR-DXB then DXB-SYD. First leg was great journey considering was on the A380 so much space and room to move about the aircraft. Inflight entertainment was excellent so much on offer (all four flights) maybe too much on offer. Was hard to pick what to watch. Food was decent though I did order special meals to get served first. Second Leg was in a B777-300 this flight was jammed full! Limited seat pitch and hard to get out of the seats and crowded. Staff on this flight very slow and a smile seemed to difficult. LHR-DXB was excellent although the purser seemed a bit childish! Flight wasn't full but still busy. Now the DXB-SYD this were the troubles begin! Check in agent in LHR doesn't check all the way through to the final stop. Got to the gate in DXB wasn't checked in came as a shock so spent 13 hours in Dubai which thanks to Qantas was made easy not Emirates. DXB-SYD night flight with night arrival. Flight was full but once again on an A380 so made that journey a little easier. Overall a good journey with Emirates!,9,13th January 2014,Australia
2312,Business class Dubai to Los Angeles - 16 hour flight regular fare and the entertainment system did not work on my seat kept resetting itself. Cabin attendant friendly but apart from resetting (which he did about 5-6 times) he didn't offer any other options. After nearly 3 hours I asked for the purser who re-set yet again twice and finally offered a change of seat. The selection of the entertainment wasn't great. Food average. I took another trip in December to Europe again due to the direct connection but again very poor selection on entertainment and food was not good at all. I would book Emirates again or recommend to family/friends but only if the price is much lower than other options.,3,13th January 2014,United Arab Emirates
2313,Perhaps it really doesn't quite get any better than this. Traveling in Emirates suites on the 777-300ER from Bangkok to Amsterdam is pure luxury and there are less than a handful of airlines that can compete with this product. The suite is luxuriously appointed very private and the seat converts into a very plush bed. You may as well be flying in a private jet. The service is impeccable. From the champagne Arabic coffee and dates that greet you prior to take-off to the a la carte food menu that you can choose to eat at any time the service is attentive friendly but not over-bearing. Perhaps the only complaint for the 777-300ER product would be that the lavatories are a bit cramped. Given that you want to change into your pj's prior to take-off there could be a bit more space to change.,9,13th January 2014,Singapore
2314,"Flew from HK to Lyon via Dubai for Xmas holiday. I usually fly with Cathay but this trip with Emirates was much cheaper this time and since I had never tried Emirates before I gave it a try. Overall it was good but I think it depends on the aircraft you are in. For HK to Dubai was in a Boeing 777 seems a brand new one inflight entertainment was excellent! For Dubai to Lyon was in a A340-500 not bad either but the inflight entertainment was not as great as the on the Boeing. For the return trip was in a A330 inflight entertainment was really disappointing. Food was ok as well as staff. Compared to Cathay I would say that Emirates' crew is not as friendly as Cathay's (less smile seem to be quite ""cold"" sometimes). Nevertheless for the value for money I think I will fly again with them.",9,10th January 2014,Hong Kong
2315,DXB-DUB - Business class out and Y class back. Gold Member. The experience is a mixed bag outward in Biz pick up on time. Flight on time lounge is to me nothing but an upgrade from the main terminal with free food and drink. Staff all look over stretched and it is not in comparison to other leading airlines where you can have a quiet zone to work. Its over crowded  busy and too open meaning that all sounds travel. Flight fine very full. Staff did their job but lacked any interaction skills. Return in Y again flight over booked their policy of 3x4x3 seating on the 777 is just too tight. ICE as ever was good and staff were not attentive pressed the call button numerous time  they walked past me. Vanished for over 2-3 hours mid flight. Food on both legs was terrible had ordered a low cholesterol meal with low fat. Both times a salad with lettuce and tomato no dressing and fish in biz class was actually burnt so bad to was like plastic. I asked for an alternative and they had Biriyani. You get better in Y class on Saudia for a 1.5 hour flight. In Y class on return chicken breast that you could put through a window and white rice inedible. Its a pity Qatar don't start entering this route as I would gladly fly them in future. Emirates are expanding at a fast track rate but seem to be loosing the edge when maintaining standards.,9,9th January 2014,United Arab Emirates
2316,In December I flew Emirates on 4 different occasions from Copenhagen to Dubai/Bangkok and I'm sorry to say that I was disappointed. The most annoying was the slow and confusing service of the cabin crew it took more than 2 hours for them to serve anything on each of the flights and it seemed like they were all trainees. On the first flight we had great large new screens for the inflight entertainment system but on the other flights the planes were equipped with an earlier version which was not at all as good. The check in and boarding procedures worked fine although there are always a lot of people who don't understand the boarding priorities. The food and beverage were of average quality and you more or less had to go and ask for the drinks by yourself. I will travel with Emirates again if I will get a good price but not for the comfort and service level.,8,9th January 2014,Sweden
2317,Kuala Lumpur to London Heathrow on 5th January 2014. The prices are reasonable and the service is quite good. 2 years ago I felt the attitude of the cabin crew was poor so I avoided the airline after that. The staff were not responding to calls and was even rude to passengers. This year I thought I'd use Emirates again. I rang my call button twice and both times it took them more than half an hour to respond. They just didn't seemed bothered about serving. The food was served very late. In summary Emirates is a good airline but they just need to buck up with the cabin crew service.,8,9th January 2014,United Kingdom
2318,MEL-AKL-MEL A380. Check in was easy and pleasant staff onboard were professional and helpful. Emirates are fantastic when travelling with children. A380 aircraft is comfortable and pleasant to travel in and the bar at 40 thousand feet a wow factor. Food was good for airline food. Ice entertainment excellent. I would recommend.,7,8th January 2014,Australia
2319,GLA-DXB-BKK-DXB-GLA. I flew from Glasgow on the evening flight to Dubai on EK 026 on 10 Dec and have to say the service from the cabin crew was outstanding and very friendly. Meals and drinks were given in good quantities and the service was fantastic for a night flight. Well done However next flight on EK 372 to Bangkok on the A380 was appalling and inappropriate for the standard of Emirates. No bar service bad food and poor cabin crew. I feel bad in saying this. Return flight was on 07 Jan on EK 371 evening flight to Dubai service was again outstanding friendly cabin crew poor food as only breakfast but it was a late night flight. Good full bar service and outstanding cabin crew which did an excellent job. Last flight was on EK027 and the cabin crew were excellent food was very good and a good bar service which was up to Emirates high standards. I have been flying with Emirates for over 10 years and reached Gold status but now have Blue status. I feel that overall Emirates is excellent good value for money have excellent cabin crew which fly on modern aircraft with a good safety record. The downside is the A380 flights are a hit and miss and overrated. Also I feel Emirates has expanded too quickly to take on other middle east airlines and that the Emirates high standards are falling.,2,8th January 2014,United Kingdom
2320,I flew with my husband on our first Emirates flight on EK434 and EK435 Business Class to Brisbane in November we usually fly BA or Singapore Airlines. I have a few comments to make on the trip first of all the food and drink service was appalling. We had to wait for service were omitted on several occasions and by the time the drink came around the meal was finished. I asked for drinks on a number of occasions and didn't get it even using 2 different male/female cabin crew. I had to get up myself and go to the bar for water on several occasions to find the staff chatting quite happily in the rear oblivious to the alert light I had pressed for assistance . But the most disappointing part of the trip was on the short stopover in Dubai business Lounge on the return flight we expected to have a shower and change. The facilities in Dubai were pathetic there were queues and the turnover in cleaning the shower cubicles was painfully slow. We gave up and continued on our journey without refreshing the Business lounge in Dubai leaves much to be desired it is difficult to find food and the way it is designed could definitely be improved. After British Airways and Singapore Airlines and Qantas we would put it bottom of the list.,9,6th January 2014,United Kingdom
2321,"ZRH-DXB-MRU 8/12/13 Business out. Business is is OK but not ""world class"". Staff are attentive but not all the time ! Return in economy. Emirates economy must be one of the most uncomfortable experiences of any airline. 10 seats abreast on a 777 no footrest on the DXB-MRU leg on an old aircraft. Emirates must be one of the most overrated airlines on this site.",1,6th January 2014,France
2322,SYD-AKL-MEL A380. Very disappointing I have flown Emirates about 10 times and it is consistently deteriorating now to the point where it is not worth bothering with. The previously generous and hi-spec economy meals have been replaced with a smaller tray with much lower quality food. The crew on both flights were unprofessional to the point of it being quite sad on the first flight the service was a shambolic mess and on the second they were far more concerned with flirting with each other and chatting rather than serving passengers. Call bells were never answered meal service took far too long on both flights and the toilets were utterly revolting despite the newish aircraft. Only good part is the IFE. Sorry to say I won't fly Emirates ever again.,3,6th January 2014,Australia
2323,DXB-FCO-DXB with A380-800. Wonderful experience starts at the A380 dedicated hub a modern brand new mall with excellent food and shopping offering. Boarding despite the aircraft size and the number of fellow passengers is fairly fast. Seating is spacious and the seat when laid back moves both the back and the seat giving the feeling of having double the inclination and increasing the comfort. Food was served and it was very tasty probably one my best experience in economy class. The entertainment screen was outstanding endless channels games and not to mention the WIFI available onboard and the fact that mobile was working perfectly while cruising at 39000 feet. Amazing experience for an economy class flight both outbound and inbound.,5,6th January 2014,United Arab Emirates
2324,Flew from Melbourne to Singapore on First with my wife. Two cars came to pick us up from the hotel and after insisting that one is enough for both of us and our baggage I sent of the other car. Check-in was pretty quick and the staff at the counter noticed that it was my wife's birthday so he chatted with us while processing our baggage. Immigration clearance was done swiftly with the fast track card. Spent an hour at the lounge before making our way to the boarding gate. FAs welcomed us warmly and ushered us to our suites. I have planned to surprise my wife with a cake so I arranged for it over the phone with Emirates contact centre way before my travel date. The suite was big as A380's (We flew on a B777-300ER) and the crew were excellent. Pre-take off drink with nuts Arabic coffee with dates cold towels Bvlgari amenity kits Pyjamas and Menu card were distributed while taxing for take-off. They offered an a la carte dinning with wide variety of selections. The food was fantastic. Especially the Arabic mezze (a must try). Restaurant quality food and the service were efficient. Plates were cleared promptly and the next course was served on time. The chief FA came by my seat and requested to meet him at the business class galley so that we plan for the surprise without attracting too much attention from my wife. He showed me the cake and I bought a gift from the on-board DFS. They brought the cake with tiny lights around it and greeted her. They took plenty of Polaroid photos of us. It was a very memorable flight for both of us.,9,6th January 2014,Singapore
2325,MAD-DXB-NRT-DXB-MAD. All flights served with 777-200LR and 777-300ER. All flights left on time and arrived on time or early. Seats were comfortable enough as to manage some hours sleep and seat pitch adequate it didn't feel that cramped as stated in previous reviews but I guess because I picked the two seat row at the very end of the cabin. All seats I preselected were honoured which was nice. Outbound I did online check-in which worked fine and used the dedicated online check-in counter at Madrid which permitted me to skip the long queues for economy check-in. On board cabin crew were polite and hard working specially on the NRT-DXB leg. All requests were promptly met and you could ask for any kind of drinks and snacks between meals. Food was nice and tasty and portions adequate with several options to choose from I missed breakfast service on MAD-DXB leg though. IFE is the highlighted point of Emirates selection of movies is huge in so many different languages Big high resolution screens and an easy to navigate system. A great experience overall and looking forward to fly with them again.,1,3rd January 2014,Spain
2326,We were a group of 4 that flew AKL-MEL in EK 403 (QF 8761) on Dec 25. It was a very pleasant flight with A-380.,2,3rd January 2014,Indonesia
2327,The chauffeur arrived at the hotel on time and helped us to load the luggage and drove us to the airport on a Holden Statesman car. The Emirates Check-in counter is the first counter in the row which is quite convenient. Check-in was swift and we were handed a pre-clearance form along with our boarding passes. We cleared past the baggage screening and emigration in a jiffy. We made our way to the Emirates lounge located right above the departure hall. At the boarding gate they have a separate pathway for First and business class passengers. The FAs welcomed us and guided us to our suites. We were given a pre-take off drink cold towel and Arabic coffee while we waited for rest of the flight to be filled up. A FA came to my suite and introduced himself and gave me a Leather bind menu card and told me that it's not an a la carte dining that night as it was just a four hour flight. Right after the take-off the FA came to take the dinner order. I ordered a Mocktail while waiting for my dinner to be served and it was served promptly with warm nuts. Dinner menu and the choices were pleasing and the food was great. We decided to shower the shower attendant notified us once the shower was ready. The shower was huge and had two types of timeless spa products. A series of shower gel shampoo and moisturiser for relaxation and another series of products to feel refreshed. Other amenities such as razors shaving cream moisturiser cologne and hairdryer were available too. When I returned to my seat the FA came with a detox drink and asked if I wanted the bed to be made. I relaxed at the bar's lounge seats while waiting for bed to be made. When I returned the seat was made flat and all set comfy with mattress duvet and a Godiva chocolate placed on my desk. Overall it was a pleasant flight and great service.,8,3rd January 2014,Singapore
2328,NCL-DXB DXB-BKK-HKG then return on the same flights. Outbound Newcastle to Dubai on 777-300ER. Very good flight - good food good choice ICE entertainment system. Dubai to Hong Kong via Bangkok on A380. Again very good flight - spacious seats and same ICE system as on previous flight. Food reasonably good on this leg of the journey but not as good as first flight. The choice I wanted was unavailable on BKK to HKG leg but the option I was served was nice enough. Return Hong Kong to Dubai via Bangkok A380. Same comments apply about A380 as before. Another good flight except food on this flight. Food on both HKG - BKK and BKK - DXB legs were poor and a massive contrast to the other 3 flights. I experienced the same on a previous Emirates Hong to Dubai flight so this looks a like a localised Hong Kong supplier issue. Dubai to Newcastle on 777-300ER - same as outbound - very good flight and very good food. Both 777-300ER and A380 used same ICE so same inflight entertainment across all flights - loads to choose from and good variety. Touch screen sometimes a little unresponsive on return flights. Cabin crew were generally good and helpful with queries but slow with food service sometimes. Outbound Newcastle departure was delayed due to late incoming flight but other flights were on time or within reason. Transfer in Dubai was easy and hassle free - around 2.5 to 3 hours each time. Overall except for the couple of things mentioned above very impressed with Emirates.,6,2nd January 2014,United Kingdom
2329,Travelled from Manchester to Lahore. Seats were fairly comfortable staff was very good food was nice toilets were clean. Inflight entertainment was really good I enjoyed watching the movies. The only thing that I didn't like was the delay of up to 20 minutes!,1,2nd January 2014,United Kingdom
2330,Economy class from Dubai to Bangkok on A380. The hype was great and the result disappointing the seats were narrow minimum leg room and back of the seat in front of me reclines into my lap. Furthermore I felt that the seats were as cramped as on a charter flight. I will choose an old 747 or 777 for my future travels. I recommend Emirates but not the A380 for tall passengers.,4,2nd January 2014,Australia
2331,I flew from Dubai to Perth (return) in Dec 2013. I am very impressed with their quality of customer service and hospitality. This 11 hour flight felt much shorter as I was very comfortable relaxed and entertained by the ICE system. It was also very comfortable to sleep in the very wide seats. USB and mains power supply is provided for charging devices. The highlights of these flights were certainly the crew and the catering which was of a very high quality served to you with steel cutlery. Even economy passengers receive luxuries normally expected for business and first passengers. The crew spoke very many languages and were very approachable. Emirates certainly deserve number 1 airline for the years to come and I wish to fly with them to Australia again.,3,30th December 2013,Austria
2332,Flew from Brisbane to Auckland in business class on an A380. The business class is located on the top deck of the flight. Two sections with 1-2-1 configuration which enables aisle access for all passengers. The single seats on both sides are not aligned with the center seats thus giving you some privacy. The crew warmly greeted and guided us to our seats as we entered the flight. The stewardess introduced herself and told me that she has been assigned to look after for the day's flight and offered the breakfast menu and a pre-take off drink. Each seat had its own selection of drinks that includes a fruit juice two fizzy drink cans still and sparkling water. My wife decided to sleep through the breakfast service but the attendant was concerned and asked if she is feeling ok. The breakfast included fresh fruits freshly squeezed juices toasted muesli and yoghurt. The hot selection served omelettes and sausages or classic French toasts. I went for French toasts with maple syrup and berries. Food was warm and tasty. I ended of my meal with a cappuccino which had Emirates logo dusted on the foam. Nice touch The in-flight entertainment was great with wide variety of movies and dramas. The noise cancelling headphones were good too. The only downside of the center business class seats are leg space. It feels cramped with the leg room extending below the seat in front you.,2,30th December 2013,Singapore
2333,CMB-SIN in late December. Flight boarded late although had arrived on time from DXB with no explanation and a call 40 mins before anything happened. Relatively comfortable seating on a 777 - the two of us had one of the only rows with only two seats at the very back. Great inflight entertainment but let down by lousy service. They seemed disorganised at best and the meal and drinks took 2.5 hours to arrive. Quality of food not good but given plenty of actually drinkable wine with a smile and apologies. Great arrival experience in SIN - we were out 20 mins after touch-down.,7,30th December 2013,Germany
2334,"EK 201 on 26 November. Return on 24 December. A380 JFK-DXB. Staff were unprofessional. Spent a lot of time chatting in the galley while setting up and serving meals took a long time. In between meals a fasten seat belt sign was on for long spells with no apparent turbulent weather and no one allowed to leave seats even to head to a toilet! No drinks were offered so people had to make their way to the galley. Once a meal is served it takes hours for the trays to be cleared. Passengers walked the trays to the galley themselves! Although the menus are handed out at the start (on one leg it was the wrong one) most often in economy the choices had completely run out and the only comment from the staff was ""we have bad news"". The A380 is too big too crowded too noisy too uncomfortable too irritating and no way to travel on a long haul.",3,30th December 2013,United States
2335,LHR-HKG via DXB. The seat pitch was surprisingly generous aboard the A380 EK006 from Heathrow to Dubai. The ICE entertainment was superb the staff were friendly and the catering was above average. What I disliked the most was the boarding 'process' they had to make it sound 'so grand'. I sat at the front and by the time I boarded and requested for eyeshades they were gone already. Also it is very hard to hear what the guy was saying as there were a battle of voices between our flight and the Qantas flight at the next gate. The queues for transfer were very long in Dubai but it was pretty inefficient. However it takes 40 minutes to get from the first gate to the second although at a leisurely pace. The second flight from DXB-HKG was far more horrible. We had to endure the horrendous 3-4-3 configuration. The ICE entertainment on the 777-300 was not as modern as the A380 thus the person behind me had to press the screen with tremendous force every time to get his TV working. The screens were also far smaller and much harder to operate. But in terms of service it was really average. In conclusion the first flight was close to being perfect and the second flight slightly disappointing.,7,30th December 2013,Hong Kong
2336,We flew 4 times with Emirates LGW-DXB-IKA IKA-DXB-LGW. We flew there and back from DXB on a B777-300er it was very quiet. Entertainment was very good with the latest movies. But the flight to IKA from DXB was a let down the entertainment had 20 channels. The food was very nice. I would fly Emirates again.,5,30th December 2013,United Kingdom
2337,MUC-MCT via DXB and return. Travelled with my wife and 1.5yr old son. The whole middle front row (4 seats) was just for us. Very comfortable seats pleasant and very helpful flight attendants. A lot of small gifts for the baby and an excellent inflight entertainment. Would definitely fly with them again!,10,29th December 2013,Slovenia
2338,Flew from Durban to London Gatwick via Dubai. The first leg of the flight was awful - seat backrest was broken staff could not fix it so they moved us to two different seats which were even worse with a solid lump at the base of the backrests that made it impossible to get comfortable in any position on this long flight. The second leg was great in a two-week old aircraft where we could finally sit in comfort. Unfortunately the Durban-Dubai experience has put me off Emirates.,8,29th December 2013,United Kingdom
2339,"Travelled on a Qantas ticket from Perth Australia to London Gatwick on 19th December. Firstly we could not find an overhead locker to out our 1 piece of luggage in. I asked an attendant to assist us and he stated ""I am not a luggage attendant"". Next it took 2 hours to be offered any form of refreshment and then it was abysmal. I wanted another drink and buzzed for assistance but nobody came. The inflight entertainment was excellent though but all in all a bad flight - Perth to Dubai. Dubai airport - the Emirates lounge was the best I have ever been in and enjoyed the 4 hour lay over. Dubai to Gatwick - slightly better as the staff were a little more customer focused. Food terrible though. Will be travelling back in the new year and am not looking forward to it but this time a stop over in Dubai may make the experience a little better. Never again will I travel on Emirates unless I can afford Business class.",3,29th December 2013,Australia
2340,Cape Town to Bangkok-departed on time excellent IFE good quality food and drink. Airline staff seemed a bit scarce! But we're mostly engaging and friendly. Transit through Dubai is not a pleasure the airport is one of the most unsettling places to visit. Pity the airline and the airport are so different.,6,29th December 2013,South Africa
2341,Flew 6 flights recently in business with Emirates. All on 777 and A380. All flights on time Glasgow to Dubai then to Bangkok to Sydney Melbourne to Singapore then to Dubai and back to Glasgow. Every car arrived on time check in a breeze as was passport control with special pass. Made travelling a pleasure. All personnel were fantastic kind and attentive. Food great as was wine and in every detail Emirates are way beyond the competition. Have read some other reviews which are rather negative. Since we flew so many times I fail to understand the problem. Compared to recent BA experience to New York Emirates are on another level.,6,29th December 2013,United Kingdom
2342,The fleets are new comfy. Flew Narita-Dubai-Munich and Rome-Narita. Always wanted to try A380. The FA's were awful. On one flight the table was dirty. I took 4 flights in total and every time I experienced something horrible. Firstly they didn't give me the bread and I had to ask 2 times for it next I had to wait over 15 mins to receive my main dish. I asked for water that I didn't receive. This is the worst airline service I have experienced so far.,10,29th December 2013,Japan
2343,NBO-SIN-NBO. First leg was alright but nothing great. Food service was slow and FA didn't clear trays for ages. Second leg to Singapore on A380 was much anticipated but disappointing seat configuration thus narrow seats thus alot of discomfort. SIN-DXB was much better but had to keep asking for water/drinks. Don't know why they just don't offer bottles of water like in business class. Flying from Singapore to Perth on Qantas we were given bottles of water to rehydrate - great for a 5 hours flight and essential for a 10+ hour flight which Emirates should consider. Last flight was the worst - lots of turbulence so we didn't get any meals. Not Emirates fault but the crew were very unprofessional. Very thirsty flight again as not enough water/drinks provided. Granted we had to remain seated during the turbulence but one cup of water and 1 juice is not enough for a 5 hour flight. Cabin crew on all sectors were not very helpful and not very friendly. Same could be said of counter staff at the business class lounge. We've been flying Emirates for 10 years and except for the last couple of years due to a change in our country of abode and travel patterns have had to use other airlines so have slipped down to Skywards silver status. We were planning to use Emirates more for our 2014 flights but will now consider other airlines. The only saving grace is the ICE entertainment system which helps you forget the lack of water/drinks the bland food and that tray in front of you.,8,25th December 2013,Australia
2344,"Bangkok to Sydney. Have previously flown this leg 6 times with a well-known Thai based airline. As per our Sydney to Bangkok flight with Emirates the boarding was delayed. At least this time there were announcements from the boarding gate to explain what was happening. The dinner was a decent size but bland and tasteless. The menu only offers 1 dish to choose from. Then the so-called ""breakfast"" was just a tiny fruit salad with a bread roll. On the other airline I alluded to above the menu has 2 dishes to choose from (for both dinner & breakfast). The breakfast is also a full meal in itself. The cabin crew seemed a little more polite than on the Sydney to Bangkok leg although I still would not describe them as friendly or welcoming. They were a little slow to bring meals and water/tea/drinks etc. I thought the Inflight Entertainment was quite good with a wide selection of programs. I'd say both airlines are equal in that regard. They did hand out a little toiletries pack which is very handy and something the other airline doesn't do. They also gave our child a small pack with some items to keep him occupied. That was a nice touch and again something the other airline does not do. In summary I found Emirates to be overrated. The tickets were cheaper than the other airline by quite a few hundred dollars and did have a couple of little nice hand-outs the other airline does not. However I think that does not make up for the uncomfortable seating and unfriendly service.",4,23rd December 2013,Australia
